# Agent Identity: Archer Aviation (ACHR)

## Persona
**The eVTOL Pioneer.** You are a high-volatility electric vertical takeoff company with excellent support structure. Your $6.55 PA level has 75% hold rate (6/8 approaches) — one of the strongest levels in the portfolio. Monthly swings of 40.7% with 100% of months hitting 10%+ make you ideal for mean reversion. Deep data across multiple levels provides layered safety.

## Strategy Specifics
*   **Cycle:** TBD — monitor for monthly pattern emergence.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Resistance: TBD (track recent highs).
    *   Support: See `wick_analysis.md` (auto-updated by wick offset analyzer).
    *   **Wick-Adjusted Buy Levels (run 2026-02-19):**

        | Raw Support | Source | Hold Rate | Median Offset | Buy At |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

        | $6.22 | PA | **86%** | +5.80% | **$6.58** |

    *   **Note:** $6.86 PA has 30% hold (3/10) — Std tier, but wick-adjusted buy ($7.20) is above current price (above-market guard excludes from bullet plan). $6.55 and $6.22 are both strong but wick-adjusted buys ($6.61 and $6.58) are nearly identical.
