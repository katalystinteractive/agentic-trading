#### Record Defense AI Spending Opens a Procurement Window
*Source: PR Newswire | Date: 2026-02-12 | Sentiment: Negative (-0.30)*

> Issued on behalf of VisionWave Holdings, Inc.

> NEW YORK,Feb. 12, 2026/PRNewswire/ --USA News GroupNews Commentary– The Pentagon just carved out its first-ever standalone budget line for autonomy, requesting $13.4 billion for AI-driven platforms[1]across aerial, ground, and maritime domains. That spending lands as the U.S. Army outsources its entire helicopter pilot training pipeline[2]to a single contractor under a 26-year deal at Fort Rucker, replacing four fragmented contracts with one enterprise training up to 1,500 aviators per year.VisionWave Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ: VWAV),Lockheed Martin(NYSE: LMT),Northrop Grumman(NYSE: NOC),Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR), andWoodward(NASDAQ: WWD) are building the perception, training, and control systems at the center of this procurement cycle.

> The Defense Innovation Unit is offering $100 million[3]to prototype vehicle-agnostic orchestration software capable of translating battlefield commander intent into coordinated autonomous execution across multi-domain fleets. Every service branch increased its AI allocation within the DoD's $66 billion IT budget for 2026[4], positioning autonomous sensing and cross-platform integration as the primary capability gaps driving procurement this cycle.

> VisionWave Holdings, Inc.(NASDAQ: VWAV) recentlydemonstrated compelling real-world performanceofSaverOne'sRF-based Vulnerable Road User (VRU) detection platform in front of a major vehicle manufacturer, revealing technology capable of identifying pedestrians in complete darkness and behind physical obstructions where conventional sensors fail. The live test marked a significant step forward for pedestrian safety technology built on fundamentally different principles than anything currently deployed in the automotive sector.

> Rather than depending on cameras, radar, or LiDAR, SaverOne's system detects electromagnetic signals emitted by mobile devices that pedestrians carry. This RF-based approach eliminates the line-of-sight requirement that limits every optical and laser-based sensor on the market today. For autonomous vehicle developers still grappling with edge-case failures, the distinction is critical: the system identifies threats that remain completely invisible to traditional perception stacks.

*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-09 | Sentiment: Positive (+1.00)*

> Archer Aviation Inc.ACHR shares have lost 23.5% in the past six months, underperforming the Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry’s growth of 10.4% as well as the broader Zacks Aerospace sector’s gain of 10.5%. It has also lagged the S&P 500’s gain of 10.5% in the same time frame.

> However, a stellar performance can be seen in the share price return of other industry players likeLockheed MartinLMT andL3Harris TechnologiesLHX, which have witnessed a surge of 46.3% and 29.3%, respectively, in the past six months.With ACHR shares declining over the past six months, investors may have mixed views. Some may remain cautious, while others may see the decline as an opportunity. Before deciding whether to buy, hold or sell, it is important to review whether the company’s fundamentals support long-term growth or if near-term challenges are likely to persist. Evaluating ACHR’s growth prospects and risks can help in making a well-informed investment decision.

> Archer Aviation continues to strengthen its position in the eVTOL market through technology-driven initiatives and international expansion efforts.In January 2026, Archer Aviation announced plans to develop and deploy next-generation Artificial Intelligence technologies for aviation using NVIDIA’s IGX Thor platform. The company intends to use Physical AI to improve aircraft safety, airspace integration and autonomy-ready systems. Archer Aviation plans to demonstrate this NVIDIA-enabled technology at its recently acquired Hawthorne Airport facility in central Los Angeles, which is expected to serve as the operating base for its planned Los Angeles air taxi network as well as a testing site for AI-based aviation solutions.In the same month, Archer Aviation entered into a strategic partnership with the Government of the Republic of Serbia, which is seeking to support the adoption of electric air taxis across Europe. Under this agreement, Serbia named ACHR as its preferred eVTOL partner and holds an option to purchase an initial fleet of Midnight aircraft. The arrangement allows for the purchase of up to 25 aircraft, subject to regulatory and legal approvals, marking a key step in Archer Aviation’s expansion into the European urban air mobility market.

> While Archer Aviation shows near-term potential, its long-term outlook remains uncertain. The eVTOL industry is still in its early stages, and the company’s success will depend on its ability to design, certify and scale production as the market evolves. The pace of industry development and the level of demand for eVTOL aircraft will play a key role in shaping results. In addition, concerns around safety, noise levels and affordability could affect public acceptance and may constrain broader adoption.

> The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ACHR’s 2026 loss indicates a year-over-year improvement of 12.6%.
