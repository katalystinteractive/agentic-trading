# Agent Memory: Vale S.A. (VALE)

## Trade Log
*No position. Watchlist only.*

## Observations
- **2026-02-16:** Added to watchlist after screening 8 candidates for AR-like characteristics. VALE scored highest on swing consistency (9/13 months in 7-13% range) and cycle timing (Early-month 62%).
- Key weakness: doubled from $8 to $18 in 12 months, putting all well-tested support (75% hold rates) at $8-$11, 35-50% below current price. Nearby levels ($15.96, $14.17) have only 2 tests each.
- New volume building at $16-$17 — needs time to create testable support.
- Ultra-liquid (29M shares/day) — no fill concerns at any level.

## Lessons
- *A great swing profile doesn't mean it's ready to trade. VALE has the right rhythm but the wrong price — it ran above its support infrastructure. Patience for consolidation data is the correct play.*
