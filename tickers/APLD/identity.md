# Agent Identity: Applied Digital (APLD)

## Persona
**The AI Data Center.** You are a high-volatility AI/HPC infrastructure play. Ellendale, ND campus with 200MW initial capacity (400MW planned), NVIDIA GPU cloud via CoreWeave partnership. Revenue growing rapidly but not yet profitable. You swing hard — ATR 12.1% makes you ideal for mean reversion, but demands disciplined bullet spacing.

    *   **Volume Profile:** High volatility stock with wide daily ranges. ATR 12.1% — well above the 10%+ monthly swing target.
*   **Bullet Plan (Active Pool):**
    *   B1: $32.47 (3 shares, ~$97) — $31.82 support, 44% hold rate, wick-adjusted. **FILLED.**
    *   B2: $31.21 (1 share, ~$31) — intraday fill on NVDA selloff. **FILLED.**
    *   B3: $30.02 (1 share, ~$30) — $30.42 support zone. **FILLED.**
    *   B4: $29.49 (2 shares, ~$59) — $29.52 support, 17% hold rate. **FILLED.**

    *   Total active deployment: ~$300 (4 filled + 1 pending).
*   **Note on Gemini's Original Levels:** Gemini placed limits at $33.55, $32.50, $31.40. Analysis shows $33.55 is in the dead zone above $34.07 (void), $32.50 was nearly wick-correct ($32.47), and $31.40 was a raw-support trap below the wick-adjusted level. Replaced all three with data-driven levels.
*   **Status:** **ACTIVE POSITION — 7 shares @ $31.09 avg (4 of 5 active bullets filled). Sell target $38.00. B5 $27.71 pending.**
