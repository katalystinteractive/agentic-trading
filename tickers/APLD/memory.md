# Agent Memory: Applied Digital (APLD)

## Trade Log
- **2026-02-17:** Bullet 1 filled at $32.47 (3 shares). First entry on intraday dip to $32.39.
- **2026-02-20:** Bullet 2 filled at $31.21 (1 share). Bullet 3 filled at $30.02 (1 share). Bullet 4 filled at $29.49 (2 shares). NVDA stake exit drove 6-day selloff — day range $28.92-$31.28. **Now holding 7 shares, avg $31.09. B5 $27.71 pending.**

## Observations
- **2026-02-16:** Onboarded from Gemini conversation (Feb 12-13). No position — Gemini's limits at $33.55/$32.50/$31.40 never filled (market holiday Feb 12, price recovered before fills).
- Wick analysis revealed $34.07 HVN is dead (0/6 holds). First reliable support is $31.82 (4/9 holds, 44%).
- Gemini's $32.50 was remarkably close to wick-adjusted $32.47 — only $0.03 off. Credit to Gemini for that call.
- APLD dropped from $42.27 to $29.24 in one week (Feb 2-6), demonstrating the extreme volatility that makes these deeper levels realistic entry points.
- ATR 12.1% — the highest in the portfolio. Excellent mean reversion candidate but demands respect for position sizing.

## Observations (continued)
- **2026-02-18 News: NVIDIA SOLD ENTIRE $177M STAKE.** Filed after market close Feb 17. Stock hit $30.30 intraday (day range $30.30-$33.45), closed $31.91 (-1.7% from avg). Nvidia originally invested in 2024, held 7.7M shares. Also exited WeRide and Recursion Pharma — appears to be portfolio-wide rebalancing, not APLD-specific. Roth Capital shrugged it off, kept Buy/$58 PT, says another hyperscaler lease is "imminent" (believed to be in Louisiana, Delta Forge 1, 430 MW). Northland PT $56, Craig-Hallum PT $40. Company in advanced talks for 3 sites totaling 900 MW. Zacks compares APLD favorably vs Vertiv. Sentiment: Neutral (30% positive). B2 at $29.24 is now only 8.4% away — the Nvidia exit brought price closer to our next entry.

## Lessons
- *Gemini can get close to correct levels intuitively, but systematic wick analysis catches the dead zones that intuition misses (e.g., $33.55 in the void above broken $34.07).*
