## Observations
- **2026-02-16:** Onboarded after screening 8 candidates for AR-like characteristics. CLF won on support infrastructure — 5 levels with 45-71% hold rates within 4-18% of current price, all tested 7-15 times. Best support density outside AR.
- $9.92 support held on Feb 12 (wick $9.94). $9.61 held on Feb 13 (wick $9.94). Support was tested 3 days ago and held — levels are fresh and active.
- Trading below POC ($13.83) and VWAP ($12.63) — volume gravity is bullish. CLF consolidated at $9-$10 for several months (Jul-Sep 2025), building the dense support infrastructure.
- Monthly swings are wider than AR (15-30% vs 12%), but reliable support compensates — the strategy doesn't need tight swings, it needs floors that hold.
- Steel sector is uncorrelated with the rest of the portfolio.

## Lessons
- *Support data density matters more than swing range. CLF's 11-15 test counts per level give much higher confidence than levels with only 2-3 tests (like VALE's $15.96).*
