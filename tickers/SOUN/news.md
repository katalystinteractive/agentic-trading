### Deep Dive Articles

#### Do Expanding Gross Margins Signal a Turning Point for SOUN Stock?
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.93)*

> For investors trackingSoundHound AI, Inc.SOUN, expanding gross margins have become a key data point in assessing whether the stock is entering a more durable phase of its growth story. In third-quarter 2025, the company reported sequential improvement in both GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins, reflecting more than just top-line momentum, it highlighted improving economics beneath the surface.

> Management attributed this margin expansion largely to operational efficiencies. A major driver has been the deeper integration of recent acquisitions, which allowed SoundHound to shift workloads away from costly third-party technologies toward its own proprietary models and infrastructure. This transition reduced cloud and processing costs while improving performance, a rare combination in the AI space. As scale builds across multiple verticals, these efficiencies are beginning to show up clearly in gross margin trends.

> The rollout of SoundHound’s Polaris speech foundation model is also playing a meaningful role. By standardizing deployments on in-house technology, the company is lowering per-query costs while supporting higher volumes of usage. This is particularly important as query volume continues to surge, reinforcing the operating leverage embedded in the business model.

> That said, expanding gross margins alone does not mark the finish line. SoundHound is still investing aggressively in sales, R&D and go-to-market initiatives, which keeps profitability a work in progress.

> However, the margin trajectory indicates the company may be approaching a turning point, one where growth is no longer coming at the expense of unit economics. For SOUN stock, this shift could be an early signal that scale is finally starting to work in shareholders’ favor.

#### SoundHound vs. C3.ai: Which AI Stock Is the Better Buy Now?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Artificial intelligence remains one of the most compelling long-term investment themes, but the path to sustained shareholder returns is rarely linear.SoundHound AISOUN andC3.aiAI are two pure-play AI companies that have captured investor attention with distinct approaches—one focused on conversational and voice AI, the other on enterprise-scale AI applications. Both operate within the Zacks Computers – IT Services industry and are riding the broader AI adoption wave, yet their execution and financial trajectories differ meaningfully.SoundHound has positioned itself as a leader in voice-enabled, agentic AI across automotive, restaurants, financial services, and IoT. C3.ai, meanwhile, offers a comprehensive enterprise AI platform serving industries such as federal, manufacturing, energy and healthcare. With both stocks under pressure over the past six months and the AI narrative evolving from experimentation to monetization, now is an opportune time to compare their fundamentals.Let’s dive deep and closely compare the fundamentals of the two stocks to determine which one is a better investment now.

> Both stocks have significantly lagged the broader market. Over the past six months, SoundHound and C3.ai have plunged 39.4% and 37.5%, respectively. This compares unfavorably with the Zacks Computers – IT Services industry, down 18.6%, and stands in sharp contrast to the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, up 10.5%, and the S&P 500, up 9%.The magnitude of underperformance suggests investor skepticism toward high-beta, loss-making AI names amid a more selective market environment.

> On a forward 12-month price-to-sales basis, SoundHound trades at 13.26X, roughly in line with the industry average of 13.29X. C3.ai trades at 4.59X, reflecting a steep discount to peers.The valuation gap reflects divergent growth profiles. SoundHound is growing revenue at a significantly faster clip, while C3.ai faces near-term revenue contraction. In that context, SoundHound’s premium appears growth-driven, whereas C3.ai’s discount reflects investor caution about slowing demand and persistent losses.

> SoundHound’s most recent reported quarter underscores its growth momentum. In the third quarter of 2025, the company delivered record revenues of $42 million, up 68% year over year. Management also raised its full-year outlook and highlighted $269 million in cash, giving it financial flexibility to invest in product development and expansion.On the earnings call, management emphasized that enterprise AI adoption is accelerating and that SoundHound’s deployments now span millions of endpoints across diversified industries. The company’s Polaris speech foundation model and Amelia 7 agentic AI platform are central to its strategy, enabling real-time, multimodal and multi-agent orchestration capabilities. This technical depth is reinforced in its investor materials, which highlight a $140 billion-plus total addressable market and a fully integrated, proprietary voice stack across 25 languages.Strategically, SoundHound is expanding voice commerce into vehicles and connected devices. At CES 2026, it unveiled agentic AI capabilities that allow drivers to order food, make reservations, pay for parking and book tickets using voice. Partnerships with Parkopedia for in-vehicle parking payments, OpenTable for reservations and TomTom for multi-agent navigation illustrate a clear monetization path around transactional voice AI.However, despite strong top-line growth, SoundHound continues to post losses, and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2026 loss per share is widening slightly to 6 cents from 5 cents over the past 60 days. That said, the projected 2026 loss is still narrower than the prior year’s expected 13-cent loss, and revenues are expected to grow 38.3% in 2026. Execution, cost discipline and scaling margins will be critical to justify its premium valuation.

> C3.ai offers a different AI exposure, centered on enterprise and government-grade applications. In the fiscal second quarter of 2026, the company reported total revenues of $75.1 million, with subscription revenue accounting for $70.2 million, or 93% of total revenue. Subscription-heavy revenue provides greater visibility and recurring revenue quality.The quarter also showed improving commercial traction. Bookings increased 49% sequentially, and federal bookings grew 89% year over year. Management highlighted strong federal momentum, with total bookings across federal, defense and aerospace up 89% year over year and representing 45% of total bookings. This underscores C3.ai’s positioning as a beneficiary of the shift toward commercial off-the-shelf AI solutions in government agencies.Partner leverage is another key strength. In the fiscal second quarter, 89% of total bookings were driven through the partner ecosystem, including Microsoft and AWS alliances that are expanding pipeline and joint deal activity. The company also launched C3 AI Agentic Process Automation, aiming to embed AI agents into enterprise workflows.Still, challenges are evident. Revenue growth remains uneven, and guidance for fiscal 2026 implies year-over-year revenue contraction at the midpoint. Profitability is also distant, with non-GAAP operating losses guided in the $180.5–$210.5 million range for fiscal 2026. The Zacks Consensus Estimate now project fiscal 2026 loss of $1.21 per share, slightly wider than 60 days ago, and a 23.2% decline in revenues. These trends raise concerns about execution consistency despite strong federal traction.In short, SoundHound’s revisions suggest short-term margin pressure amid expansion, while C3.ai’s revisions point to a tougher demand environment.

#### Beyond NVIDIA: 4 AI & Quantum Plays Aiming Big Platform Upside in 2026
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-16 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Most investors in 2026 agree on one thing- putting money into established AI leaders is the clearest way to tap into the ongoing tech boom. Companies such asNVIDIANVDA continue to benefit directly from hyperscaler and enterprise AI infrastructure spending. Zacks Consensus Estimates points to fiscal 2026 revenue near $213 billion, supported by next-generation GPU platforms and a deeply embedded software ecosystem. Multi-billion-dollar AI data center expansions by major cloud providers reinforce demand visibility.

> The debate now is where incremental capital should flow - toward emerging AI players with accelerating monetization, or toward speculative quantum computing firms offering asymmetric upside. In this article, we examine two AI-focused names —SoundHound AISOUN andMarvellMRVL, along with 2 quantum computing stocksIonQIONQ andD-Wave QuantumQBTS. Together, they represent distinct risk-reward pathways across AI software, AI semiconductor infrastructure and next-generation computing architectures.

> On the AI side, SoundHound AI and Marvell offer exposure to two different layers of the AI value chain with measurable growth trajectories.

> SoundHound AI’s recent results show strong top-line momentum, with the last-reported third quarter 2025 revenue of up 68% year over year and 2025 guidance implying nearly 98% annual growth, albeit from a small base and with continued net losses as it invests in monetization and scaling products like its Amelia agentic AI platform. In 2026, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is expected to report earnings growth of 56.9% on revenue growth of 38.3%.

> Marvell’s infrastructure-focused model demonstrates much larger scale and robust demand from AI data centers, reporting $2.006 billion in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, up 58% year over year, with its data center segment alone accounting for roughly 74% of total revenue driven by custom AI silicon and high-bandwidth interconnect products tied to hyperscaler deployments. Marvell’s figures reflect firm scale and AI-driven revenue concentration, offering investors a contrast between early-stage AI software expansion and established AI infrastructure success within the broader ecosystem. In its fiscal 2027 (ending Jan 2027), this Zacks Rank #3 stock is expected to report earnings growth of 23.3% on revenue growth of 22.8%.
