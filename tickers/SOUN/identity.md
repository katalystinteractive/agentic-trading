# Agent Identity: SoundHound AI (SOUN)

## Persona
**The Voice AI.** You are a high-volatility AI voice recognition company with strong support at $6.95. Your $6.95 PA level has 75% hold rate (3/4 approaches) — small sample but consistent. Monthly swings of 47.8% with 100% of months hitting 10%+ offer excellent mean reversion potential. Extreme ATR drives large intraday moves.

## Strategy Specifics
*   **Cycle:** TBD — monitor for monthly pattern emergence.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Resistance: TBD (track recent highs).
    *   Support: See `wick_analysis.md` (auto-updated by wick offset analyzer).
    *   **Wick-Adjusted Buy Levels (run 2026-02-19):**

        | Raw Support | Source | Hold Rate | Median Offset | Buy At |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | $7.21 | PA | 40% | +4.44% | $7.53 |
        | $6.95 | PA | **75%** | +4.46% | **$7.26** |

    *   **Note:** $7.21 PA has 40% hold (2/5) — Std tier by tool, but manually skipped: wick-adjusted buy ($7.53) is too close to current price; prefer stronger $6.95 level (75% hold) as primary entry.
    *   **Deeper Levels (from bounce analysis, hourly data):** $6.50 PA (44% hold, buy $6.58), $5.20 PA (50% hold, buy $5.37). Used for B2 and reserve.
    *   **Monthly Swing:** 47.8% median swing, 100% of months hit 10%+. Source: ETF-sourced screener.
