CEO Yehoshua Nir emphasized operational improvements and “a renewed commitment to delivering a best-in-class customer experience,” while also noting ongoing efforts to streamline the product portfolio.

Management identified the scaling of U.S. production, expanding battery storage solutions, and entry into AI data center power as key growth opportunities. CFO Asaf Alperovitz highlighted that, while the company anticipates margin expansion and positive free cash flow in the near term, investments in product development and manufacturing will remain elevated.
