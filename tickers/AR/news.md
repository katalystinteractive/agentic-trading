#### Antero Resources Announces Fourth Quarter 2025 Results and 2026 Guidance
*Source: PR Newswire | Date: 2026-02-11 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> DENVER,Feb. 11, 2026/PRNewswire/ --Antero Resources Corporation (NYSE: AR)("Antero Resources," "Antero," or the "Company") today announced its fourth quarter 2025 financial and operating results, year end 2025 estimated proved reserves and 2026 guidance. The relevant consolidated financial statements are included in Antero Resources' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025.

> Michael Kennedy, CEO and President of Antero Resources commented, "2025 was a pivotal year for Antero as we took significant steps in increasing our production and drilling inventory. During the year we completed a transaction to acquire higher working interest in our wells, followed by the largest acquisition in our company's history, acquiring our West Virginia peer, HG Energy. The recent closing of the HG Energy acquisition was ahead of schedule and will increase our scale and dry gas exposure. This larger production base and inventory positions Antero to capture the significant demand opportunities that are expected from LNG exports, data centers and natural gas fired power plants."

> Mr. Kennedy continued, "Our 2026 budget highlights these transformational changes as our production base increases from 3.4 Bcfe/d in 2025 to more than 4.2 Bcfe/d by year end 2026. We intend to run 3 drilling rigs and 2 completion crews, which provides us with the optionality to grow our production base further if supported by the commodity price backdrop and in basin demand opportunities."

> Brendan Krueger, CFO of Antero Resources added, "The closing of the HG Energy acquisition immediately improves our competitive positioning by significantly reducing our cost structure and increases our local dry gas exposure. These higher margins are hedged and are expected to drive a substantial increase in Adjusted Free Cash Flow and reduce leverage to under 1.0x during the year. We intend to remain focused on debt reduction and continuing to opportunistically repurchase shares."
