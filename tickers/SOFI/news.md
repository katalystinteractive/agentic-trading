#### SoFi's 2026 Outlook: Margin Expansion Strengthens Further
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-11 | Sentiment: Positive (+1.00)*

> The defining takeaway fromSoFi Technologies’ SOFI 2026 outlook is not just growth, but margin expansion at scale. While revenue and membership gains remain impressive, the real inflection lies in how efficiently that growth is translating into profits.

> Management’s projections indicate another year of roughly 30% top-line expansion, supported by continued traction in lending, financial services and its broader platform ecosystem. Member growth is expected to remain robust, signaling sustained demand and strong customer engagement. However, revenue growth alone does not differentiate fintech platforms in today’s market. Profit durability does.

> What stands out is the expected operating leverage. EBITDA margins are guided into the mid-30% range, while net income margins are projected to approach the high teens. Those signals are improving cost absorption, disciplined expense control, and a more mature revenue mix. Earnings per share are also set to rise meaningfully, reinforcing that incremental revenue is increasingly falling to the bottom line.

> Importantly, first-quarter expectations suggest stability rather than volatility, implying that momentum exiting 2025 is carrying forward without relying on unusually favorable conditions.

> In essence, 2026 appears positioned as a year where SoFi transitions from a rapid-growth fintech to a scaled, margin-driven operator. If execution matches guidance, margin strength, not just revenue expansion, could become the primary valuation driver.
