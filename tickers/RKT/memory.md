- **2026-02-19:** Onboarded as surgical candidate. Monthly swing 30.5% (100% consistency) with unusual convergence pattern — three active levels ($16.90, $16.48, $16.07) all produce the same $17.05 wick-adjusted buy price.
- $17.72 HVN+PA excluded (10% hold, Skip tier). $17.31 HVN is a thin Half-tier entry (20% hold).
- Deep reserve structure is strong: $15.33 PA (67%), $11.36 PA (62%), $10.86 PA (83%).
- Convergence means 83% of active capital deploys at one price — noted as risk factor.
