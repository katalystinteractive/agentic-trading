# Agent Memory: Archer Aviation (ACHR)

## Trade Log
*No fills yet. Limit buy pending at $6.55 (B1).*

## Observations
- **2026-02-19:** Originally selected as bounce candidate from ETF-sourced screener (ARKX ETF holding). Converted to surgical strategy after monthly swing analysis revealed 40.7% median swing with 100% of months hitting 10%+.
- Deep data: 8 approaches at $6.55 PA with 75% hold rate — one of the strongest levels in the portfolio.
- $6.86 PA dead zone (30% hold, 3/10) — price frequently breaks through. First reliable level is $6.55.
- Five backup levels stacked from $5.20 to $6.22 provide layered defense if primary breaks.

## Lessons
- *Originally misclassified as bounce-only. Monthly swing analysis proved it's a surgical-grade swing stock. The 75% hold rate at $6.55 makes it a high-confidence entry.*
