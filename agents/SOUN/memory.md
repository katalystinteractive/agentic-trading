## Observations
- **2026-02-19:** Originally selected as first bounce strategy candidate from screener scan of 160 tickers. Converted to surgical strategy after monthly swing analysis revealed 47.8% median swing with 100% of months hitting 10%+.
- Wick analysis: $6.95 PA has 75% hold rate (3/4 approaches) — small sample but consistent. $7.21 PA above it has only 40% hold (2/5) — marginal.
- Bounce analysis provided deeper levels: $6.50 PA (44% hold, buy $6.58) and $5.20 PA (50% hold, buy $5.37) for B2 and reserve.

## Lessons
- *Originally misclassified as bounce-only. Monthly swing analysis proved it's a surgical-grade swing stock. Small sample at $6.95 (4 approaches) is a risk factor — monitor for more data.*
