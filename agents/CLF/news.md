### Deep Dive Articles

#### Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CLF) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Cleveland-Cliffs(CLF) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

> Over the past month, shares of this mining company have returned -27.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.8% change. During this period, the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, which Cleveland-Cliffs falls in, has gained 5.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

> Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

> Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

> We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

#### Nucor, Cleveland-Cliffs, Alcoa Slide As Trump Reportedly Mulls Steel & Aluminum Tariff Rollback
*Source: Benzinga | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.46)*

> Steel's protection party may be ending. Shares ofNucor Corp(NYSE:NUE),Cleveland-Cliffs Inc(NYSE:CLF), andAlcoa Corp(NYSE:AA) fell Friday afterreportsthat U.S.PresidentDonald Trumpis considering reversing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.

> The reaction was swift. Steel and aluminum producers — long beneficiaries of tariff protection — traded lower by 5-6% in early intraday trading, as investors began pricing in the possibility of renewed foreign competition and softer domestic pricing power.

> Tariffs have acted as a cushion for U.S. producers, supporting margins and limiting cheaper imports. If rolled back, that cushion thins.

> The market isn't waiting for official paperwork. Traders moved quickly to de-risk metal names, particularly those most sensitive to domestic pricing spreads. Cleveland-Cliffs, which has leaned heavily into U.S.-focused steel exposure, saw sharper pressure, while aluminum producer Alcoa also slid on fears of lower realized pricing.

> The message: protection drives premiums. Remove it, and multiples compress.

#### CMC Jumps 69% in a Year: What's the Right Strategy for Investors Now?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-11 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Commercial Metals CompanyCMC stock has surged 68.8% in a year, outperforming the Zacks Steel - Producers industry’s 61.7% jump. Meanwhile, the Basic Materials sector has risen 47.6%, and the S&P 500 has rallied 18.9% in the same timeframe.

> The Steel-producer has also performed better than its peers likeNucor CorporationNUE andCleveland-Cliffs Inc.CLF, which have rallied 41.3% and 8.6%, respectively.

> With the CMC stock riding high, investors may rush to add it to their portfolio. However, before making a decision, it will be prudent to take a look at the reasons behind the surge, the company’s growth prospects and risks (if any) in investing.

> In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, CMC reported revenues of $2.12 billion, reflecting 11% year-over-year growth, attributed to solid demand for the North America Steel Group and Construction Solutions Group segments.In the North America Steel Group segment, the steel products metal margin increased by $132 per ton from the first quarter of fiscal 2025, achieving a year-over-year increase for the second consecutive quarter. The segment’s steel products margin climbed to the highest level in three years.Solid demand and enhanced cost efficiency in the company’s Tensar division pushed the Construction Solutions Group segment’s adjusted EBITDA margin to a record 20%. The segment reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.4% in the prior-year quarter.Backed by the tailwinds, the company reported earnings per share of $1.84 in the quarter, a year-over-year surge of 142%.However, the results were partially offset by soft market conditions for the Europe Steel Group. Even though demand in Europe continued to improve on strong Polish economic growth, import flows negatively impacted average price and margin levels. This, along with annual maintenance outages, pushed the Europe Steel Group’s adjusted EBITDA margin from 12.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to 4.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.CMC closed two major acquisitions in December 2025 — Concrete Pipe and Precast, LLC ("CP&P") and Foley Products Company. The addition of these businesses will aid the company’s results in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, offsetting the impacts of seasonal slowdown within key markets.

> However, the company will also bear several acquisition-related expenses in the fiscal second quarter, like transaction fees and debt issuance costs. CMC expects overall consolidated core EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to decline sequentially.
