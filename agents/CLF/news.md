### Deep Dive Articles

#### Nucor, Cleveland-Cliffs, Alcoa Slide As Trump Reportedly Mulls Steel & Aluminum Tariff Rollback
*Source: Benzinga | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.46)*

> Steel's protection party may be ending. Shares ofNucor Corp(NYSE:NUE),Cleveland-Cliffs Inc(NYSE:CLF), andAlcoa Corp(NYSE:AA) fell Friday afterreportsthat U.S.PresidentDonald Trumpis considering reversing tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.

> The reaction was swift. Steel and aluminum producers — long beneficiaries of tariff protection — traded lower by 5-6% in early intraday trading, as investors began pricing in the possibility of renewed foreign competition and softer domestic pricing power.

> Tariffs have acted as a cushion for U.S. producers, supporting margins and limiting cheaper imports. If rolled back, that cushion thins.

> The market isn't waiting for official paperwork. Traders moved quickly to de-risk metal names, particularly those most sensitive to domestic pricing spreads. Cleveland-Cliffs, which has leaned heavily into U.S.-focused steel exposure, saw sharper pressure, while aluminum producer Alcoa also slid on fears of lower realized pricing.

> The message: protection drives premiums. Remove it, and multiples compress.

*Source: Benzinga | Date: 2026-02-12 | Sentiment: Negative (-0.94)*

> A volatile Thursday rattled Wall Street, with technology and software stocks sliding across the board after a cautious margin outlook fromCisco Systems Inc.(NASDAQ:CSCO)reignited concerns about profit durabilityin the AI trade.

> Despite topping earnings and revenue expectations, Cisco shares tumbled more than 11% — their worst single-day drop since May 2022 — as investors fixated on softer forward guidance.

> TheiShares Tech-Expanded Software Sector ETF(NYSE:IGV), widely viewed as a barometer for AI-disruption risk, sank 3.7%, revisiting lows touched just last week.

> AppLovin Corp.(NASDAQ:APP)plunged 18% even after beating estimates, with underwhelming guidance once again overshadowing headline results. The stock is now down 45% year to date, ranking among the weakest performers in the IGV basket.

> Robinhood Markets Inc.(NASDAQ:HOOD)— one of the emblematic winners of the AI-fueled rally — slid 9%, on pace for its worst two-day selloff since the tariff shock triggered by President Trump in April 2025.

#### CMC Jumps 69% in a Year: What's the Right Strategy for Investors Now?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-11 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Commercial Metals CompanyCMC stock has surged 68.8% in a year, outperforming the Zacks Steel - Producers industry’s 61.7% jump. Meanwhile, the Basic Materials sector has risen 47.6%, and the S&P 500 has rallied 18.9% in the same timeframe.

> The Steel-producer has also performed better than its peers likeNucor CorporationNUE andCleveland-Cliffs Inc.CLF, which have rallied 41.3% and 8.6%, respectively.

> With the CMC stock riding high, investors may rush to add it to their portfolio. However, before making a decision, it will be prudent to take a look at the reasons behind the surge, the company’s growth prospects and risks (if any) in investing.

> In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, CMC reported revenues of $2.12 billion, reflecting 11% year-over-year growth, attributed to solid demand for the North America Steel Group and Construction Solutions Group segments.In the North America Steel Group segment, the steel products metal margin increased by $132 per ton from the first quarter of fiscal 2025, achieving a year-over-year increase for the second consecutive quarter. The segment’s steel products margin climbed to the highest level in three years.Solid demand and enhanced cost efficiency in the company’s Tensar division pushed the Construction Solutions Group segment’s adjusted EBITDA margin to a record 20%. The segment reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.4% in the prior-year quarter.Backed by the tailwinds, the company reported earnings per share of $1.84 in the quarter, a year-over-year surge of 142%.However, the results were partially offset by soft market conditions for the Europe Steel Group. Even though demand in Europe continued to improve on strong Polish economic growth, import flows negatively impacted average price and margin levels. This, along with annual maintenance outages, pushed the Europe Steel Group’s adjusted EBITDA margin from 12.3% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to 4.4% in the first quarter of fiscal 2026.CMC closed two major acquisitions in December 2025 — Concrete Pipe and Precast, LLC ("CP&P") and Foley Products Company. The addition of these businesses will aid the company’s results in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, offsetting the impacts of seasonal slowdown within key markets.

> However, the company will also bear several acquisition-related expenses in the fiscal second quarter, like transaction fees and debt issuance costs. CMC expects overall consolidated core EBITDA in the second quarter of fiscal 2026 to decline sequentially.

#### Jim Cramer Says Cleveland-Cliffs "Needs More Economic Activity to Do Better"
*Source: Insider Monkey | Date: 2026-02-10 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF) is one of thestocks in focus on Jim Cramer’s game plan. Cramer noted that the tariffs are hurting the stock, as he remarked:

> Monday morning, and that’s where we hear from Cleveland-Cliffs. Talk about a company that’s hurting. This is a steel company that’s done better than if there were no tariffs, but not as well as Cramer fave, Nucor, with a stock that’s had a tremendous year. Cliffs needs more economic activity to do better. It’s discouraging, but I’m not giving up on what lower interest rates could do for a steel maker that’s not as good as Nucor.

> Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF) produces flat-rolled and specialty steel products, including stainless, electrical, and tubular steels, as well as iron ore and hot-briquetted iron. A caller mentioned their outsized position in the stock during the January 26 episode and asked whether the stock was a buy, sell, or hold. In response, Cramer commented:

> Okay, my favorite is Nucor. I’m not going to recommend Cleveland-Cliffs over Nucor because I think Nucor is the superior operator and has been for some time now. You’re going to be able to buy Nucor at a discount. They reported a number of people didn’t like it, but it was at its 52-week high going into the session. Call me a buyer of Nucor on any weakness. You know, I think that Leon Topalian does a fantastic job with that company.

> While we acknowledge the potential of CLF as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on thebest short-term AI stock.

#### Cleveland-Cliffs Sinks After Earnings-Is the Selloff Overdone?
*Source: MarketBeat | Date: 2026-02-10 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE: CLF)reported mixed earnings the morning after the Super Bowl. The initial market reaction was bearish, but following the sell-off, the stock may be worth another look with fresh eyes.

> Shares of the U.S.-based steelmaker (forgive the play on words) fell off a cliff to the tune of 18.9% in midday trading the day after the report. Theresults were solid in spots, but weak elsewhere, with a better-than-expected earnings loss being offset by revenue that came in below forecast.

> A 6% miss in revenue wasn’t ideal, but it wasn't unexpected, and the company provided investors with several tangible reasons to believe 2026 will be a better year. However, with CLF stock up over 47% in the 12 months heading into earnings, many investors believed the company’s future guidance needed to be stronger.

> The stocknow sits at a level that acted as support back in October and as resistance about a year ago. This level aligns with the stock’s 150-day simple moving average (SMA), making this a key support area.

> The stock is not oversold yet, but selling action has pushed it below its lower Bollinger band. That suggests oversold conditions could emerge.
