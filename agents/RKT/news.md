*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.94)*

> Chicago, IL – February 20, 2026 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  Rocket Companies Inc. RKT, PennyMac Financial Services PFSI, Wells Fargo WFC, Bank of America BAC and JPMorgan JPM.

> The Federal Reserve is preparing to propose regulatory changes that could encourage large banks to re-enter the mortgage origination and servicing business in a more meaningful way. The effort, led by vice chair for supervision, Michelle Bowman, reflects growing concern that post-financial crisis capital rules may have unintentionally pushed mortgage activity out of the traditional banking system and into non-bank lenders.

> If implemented, the changes could significantly reshape the competitive landscape. Non-bank lenders such asRocket Companies Inc.andPennyMac Financial Servicesmay face heightened pressure as banks reassert themselves. Meanwhile, major institutions likeWells Fargo,Bank of AmericaandJPMorgancould be positioned to regain market share.

> In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, regulators strengthened capital standards under the global Basel frameworks to enhance financial stability. While these reforms made banks more resilient, they also increased the cost of holding certain mortgage-related assets. Over time, banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan’s share of mortgage originations declined significantly. At the same time, non-bank lenders gained dominance.

> A key factor was the regulatory treatment of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). Strict capital deductions and a 250% risk-weighting requirement made MSRs capital-intensive for banks. As a result, many institutions chose to sell servicing portfolios to non-bank firms, accelerating the shift of mortgage activity outside the traditional banking sector.

#### Rocket Companies (RKT) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Rocket Companies (RKT) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on  higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2025. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.

> The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 26, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.

> While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.

> This company is expected to post  quarterly earnings of $0.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +150%.

> Revenues are expected to be $2.26 billion, up 90.8% from the year-ago quarter.

#### Rocket Companies Stock Slips Thursday On Zillow Sell-Off, AI Fears
*Source: Benzinga | Date: 2026-02-12 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.55)*

> Rocket Companies Inc(NYSE:RKT) is trading lower Thursday afternoon as investors continue to de-risk housing-exposed names following a sharp, negative reaction toZillow Group Inc’s(NASDAQ:ZG)(NASDAQ:Z) latest quarterly update and a broader wave of selling across real-estate intermediaries.

> RKT is getting hit by sympathy selling tied to sentiment Thursday, as opposed to company-specific headlines. When the market turns cautious on housing demand indicators, mortgage originators often move with the group because their volumes and margins are ultimately tied tohomebuying activityand rate-driven refinance cycles.

> Zillow on Tuesdaypostedfourth-quarter revenue of $654 million, ahead of expectations, but adjusted EPS of 39 cents came in a penny light. Despite 18% year-over-year revenue growth and first-quarter sales guidance of $700 million to $710 million that topped estimates, Zillow shares still dropped about 19% after the release.

> Traders often treat Zillow as a barometer for U.S. housing activity, so a sell-the-news response can quickly weigh on names like Rocket by raising concerns about origination volumes, refinance demand and gain-on-sale margins.

> Real-estate stocks have also been rattled by investor anxiety thatnew AI toolscould disrupt fee-heavy, labor-intensive business models across the transaction ecosystem. That narrative has pressured online housing platforms after Zillow's plunge, keeping sector sentiment fragile and risk premiums elevated.
