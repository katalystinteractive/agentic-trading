*   **Bullet Plan (Active Pool):**
    *   B1: $17.69 (1 share, ~$18) — $17.31 HVN, 20% hold, Half tier.
    *   B2: $17.05 (9 shares, ~$153) — converged from $16.90 Std 42% + $16.48 Full 58% + $16.07 Full 50%. Three levels, one entry.
    *   Total active deployment: ~$171 if both fill.
*   **Reserve:**
    *   R1: $15.82 (6 shares, ~$95) — $15.33 PA, 67% hold.
    *   R2: $12.03 (8 shares, ~$96) — $11.36 PA, 62% hold.
    *   R3: $11.08 (9 shares, ~$100) — $10.86 PA, 83% hold.

*   **Status:** **ACTIVE WATCHLIST — TABLED. Convergence issue: 3 active levels produce same $17.05 buy price. Bullet plan needs rework before placing orders.**
