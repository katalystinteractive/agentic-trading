#### Kinder Morgan, Inc. (KMI) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Kinder Morgan(KMI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

> Over the past month, shares of this oil and natural gas pipeline and storage company have returned +15.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production and Pipelines industry, which Kinder Morgan falls in, has gained 12.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

> While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

> Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

> Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.
