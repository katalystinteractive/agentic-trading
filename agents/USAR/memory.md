## Observations
- Feb 12: Massive selloff. Down ~12% intraday to $18.70. Drivers: (1) Admin walked back price floor guarantees, (2) Peer CRTM tanking on Greenland tensions, (3) PIPE investors underwater at $21.50 triggering stop-losses.
- Feb 12: Stock broke below $19.00 psychological support. Intraday low $18.70.
- Feb 13: Stabilized. Closed $19.40 (+2% from intraday lows). Buying volume increased in final 30 minutes.
- Feb 13: Filled 2 @ $19.02, then 2 @ $18.75 (caught near intraday low of $18.70). Strong S1 pivot support at $18.82.
- Technical scan: Neutral-Bearish (score -2). Above SMA 50/200 (long-term uptrend intact). Below SMA 20/EMA 9/EMA 21. Stochastic oversold (6.4). ATR 15.8% — extremely volatile.
- Volume profile: POC at $17.31, VWAP at $23.05. Currently in $17.96-$19.26 zone with 64% buy volume — institutional accumulation.
- Feb 16: Wick offset analysis run. Gemini's $17.50 tranche rejected — $17.55 HVN only has 15% hold rate. Dead zone from $16.53-$15.51 (0% hold rates). Reserve levels set at wick-adjusted prices.

## Plan (Reserve Deployment)
- **Active pool exhausted** ($322.80 deployed on 15 shares, exceeds $300 limit).
- **Reserve 1:** 6 shares @ **$15.48** ($15.08 Price Action support, wick-adjusted. First reliable level below the $16-17.50 dead zone.)
- **Reserve 2:** 8 shares @ **$12.56** ($12.44 HVN support, wick-adjusted. 32% hold rate.)
- **Reserve 3:** Hold ~$100 dry powder for **$11.61** washout ($11.42 HVN, 47% hold rate — strongest level in dataset.)
- **Stop rule:** If $11.00 breaks on high volume, pre-government-backing price range is in play. Consider full exit.
- **Recovery target:** $23.05 (VWAP) for ~7% gain on current 15 shares. If Reserve 1 fills, target adjusts.

## Observations (continued)
- **2026-02-18 News:** Price $18.20 (-15.4% from avg $21.52). Day range $18.19-$19.33. Key developments: (1) $1.6B gov LOI for Round Top mine + Stillwater magnet plant, (2) Stillwater commissioning in early 2026 — one of first large-scale NdFeB magnet plants in US, (3) Completed $1.5B PIPE financing Jan 2026, cash >$400M, (4) Acquired Less Common Metals (feedstock supplier), (5) Roth PT $35, Cantor PT $35 — both see 94% upside. Still pre-revenue — expenses rising ($11.4M SGA vs $0.8M YoY). Round Top commercial production now targeted late 2028 (2 years earlier than prior). Sentiment: Neutral (30% positive). Reserve 1 at $15.48 is 14.9% away.

## Lessons
- Position entered before strategy system. Similar to IONQ and UAMY — recovery mode.
- Gemini's $17.50 tranche was at $17.55 HVN which only holds 15% of the time (broke 11/13). Our wick analyzer identified a "dead zone" from $16.53-$15.51 with 0% hold rates. Deploying capital there would be poor risk management.
- Gemini's $21.60 "confirmation buy" was a momentum play, not a support-based entry — doesn't fit our strategy framework.
- The 4-share fill at $18.75-$19.02 on Feb 13 was well-timed (near intraday low of $18.70), but the total position ($323) already exceeds the $300 active pool. Any further buying is reserve capital.
