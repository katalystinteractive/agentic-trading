### Deep Dive Articles

#### Rising Development Expenses Pressure USAR: What's the Road Ahead?
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.91)*

> USA Rare Earth, Inc.USAR is working to advance rare earth mining and magnet manufacturing operations in the United States, including the Round Top mining project in Texas and a magnet production facility in Oklahoma. However, the company is still in the pre-revenue phase, as its mining assets have not yet achieved commercial-scale output, leading to ongoing operating losses since inception.USAR has been facing escalating development expenditures as it moves forward through the project development stage. In the third quarter of 2025, the company’s selling, general and administrative expenses rose to $11.4 million from $0.8 million recorded in the year-ago quarter, due to higher legal and consulting costs, an expanded workforce, recruitment spending and additional overheads.USA Rare Earth’s research and development expenses also increased to $4.45 million from $1.16 million in the same period due to higher employee-related costs linked to staff expansion. As a result, the company posted a loss of 25 cents per share for the third quarter.Despite higher spending, USA Rare Earth continues to advance toward the targeted commercialization of multiple rare earth projects. These projects are expected to take at least several more quarters before achieving commercial production.It is worth noting that USAR disclosed that its Round Top rare earth and critical minerals project is now anticipated to commence commercial production in late 2028, which is two years earlier than its prior timeline. Until revenue generation begins, substantial project development outlays and operating expenses are expected to remain a short-term drag. The absence of revenues, along with increasing development costs, is likely to pressure the company’s near-term financial performance.

> Among its major peers,Trilogy Metals Inc.TMQ continues to maintain financial discipline as it advances work at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects through its joint venture, Ambler Metals LLC. Trilogy’s salaries expense increased in fiscal 2025, recording higher cash-based compensation compared with fiscal 2024. Trilogy Metals’ disciplined capital approach is allowing it to manage expenditures at a time when development projects often require significant investment.Its another peer,NioCorp Developments Ltd.NB, is facing cost pressure. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, its total operating expenses increased significantly on a year-over-year basis due to expenses incurred for the advancement of the Elk Creek Project. Rising costs and expenses, if not controlled, might affect NioCorp Developments’ margin performance moving ahead.

> Shares of USAR have gained 72.1% in the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 47.3%.

> From a valuation standpoint, USAR is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of negative 65.60X against the industry’s average of 15.85X. USA Rare Earth has a Value Score of F.

> The Zacks Consensus Estimate for USAR’s 2026 earnings has increased over the past 60 days.

#### USA Rare Earth Surges 35.6% in 3 Months: Should You Buy the Stock Now?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-16 | Sentiment: Positive (+1.00)*

> USA Rare Earth, Inc.USAR shares have climbed 35.6% in the past three months, underperforming the industry and outperforming the S&P 500, which have returned 35.6% and 3%, respectively. In comparison, the company’s peers likeNioCorp Developments Ltd.NB andBHP Group LimitedBHP have gained 4.2% and 34.5%, respectively, over the same time frame.

> Closing at $19.40 in the last trading session, the stock is trading below its 52-week high of $43.98 but higher than its 52-week low of $5.56. It is trading above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, indicating solid upward momentum and confidence in the company's long-term prospects.

> Let’s take a look at USAR’s fundamentals to better analyze how to play the stock.

> USA Rare Earth is working to move its Stillwater magnet manufacturing facility in Oklahoma closer to commercial production. The plant is designed to produce Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnets, which are essential for defense, aviation, automotive and other high-growth applications. The Stillwater facility is expected to become one of the first large-scale magnet plants in the United States, supporting the country’s efforts to build a domestic rare earth supply chain.USA Rare Earth is installing key equipment, assembling Line 1a and completing final preparations at the Stillwater facility for commissioning in early 2026. It is worth noting that the company began hiring and training engineers and technicians to operate the facility. These efforts are likely to improve USAR’s ability to reach commercial-scale production and help it secure long-term customer contracts.USA Rare Earth also bolstered its balance sheet through PIPE financing and warrant exercises, bringing its total cash position to more than $400 million as of November 2025. It is worth noting that the company completed the $1.5 billion PIPE financing in January 2026. This funding is being used to make upgrades at the Stillwater plant, expand magnet finishing capabilities and complete Line 1b to increase total NdFeB magnet-producing capacity to roughly 1,200 metric tons.USAR completed the acquisition of Less Common Metals in November 2025, which will supply critical metal and alloy feedstock for the Stillwater plant. In December 2025, LCM partnered with Solvay and Arnold Magnetic Technologies Corp. (Arnold) to provide a stable and premium-quality source of rare-earth materials. With this addition and continued progress across its development initiatives, the company is well-positioned to expand capacity and scale production in the quarters ahead.However, since its inception, USA Rare Earth has remained in the exploration and research stages, incurring losses while yet to generate any revenues. Amid its project development phase, the company has been grappling with rising operational expenses, adversely impacting its margins and profitability. In third-quarter 2025, USAR’s selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $11.4 million from $0.8 million in the year-ago quarter due to a rise in legal & consulting costs, higher headcount & recruiting fees, and other costs.Research and development expenses rose to $4.45 million compared with $1.16 million reported in the year-ago quarter due to an increase in employee-related expenses. The lack of revenues and elevated expenses, partially offset by higher interest and dividend income from increased money market fund balances, resulted in a loss of 25 cents per share in the third quarter.USAR operates in the mineral exploration and mining markets, which include major industry players like NioCorp and BHP Group.

> The Zacks Consensus Estimate for USAR’s bottom line for 2026 has increased in the past 60 days.

*Source: Insider Monkey | Date: 2026-02-14 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.96)*

> USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ:USAR) is among the10 best meme stocks to buy now. Its shares have returned over 60% year-to-date, with a significant surge in late January after news about the U.S. government backing a $1.6 billion funding.

> On January 26, the company announced that it had received a letter of intent for a debt-and-equity package to develop a rare-earth mine in Texas and a magnet-manufacturing facility to boost production of critical materials for the defense and tech sectors, while reducing reliance on China for supply.

> Following the development, Roth Capital on January 27 lifted its price target on USA Rare Earth, Inc. (NASDAQ:USAR) to $35 from $25, while maintaining a Buy rating. In a research note to investors, analyst Suji Desilva said the funding would help strengthen the company’s prospects for developing an end-to-end value chain for rare earth materials in the country.

> Later on January 30, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Derek Soderberg raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $35 from $28 with an Overweight rating. The analyst noted that magnet production had the potential to generate $1.2 billion in EBITDA by 2030, provided key milestones are achieved.

> As of the close of business on February 12, the stock is a Strong Buy with an average share price upside of nearly 94%.

#### Trump's Favorite Commodity Is Coming To Derivatives Market
*Source: Benzinga | Date: 2026-02-12 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.20)*

> CME Groupis working on a plan to launch the world's first futures contract in rare earth. If it goes through, this move would help numerous parties to hedge exposure to a sector dominated by China.

> Reuters has spoken to three sources familiar with the matter. According to the information, CME is considering a contract tied to neodymium and praseodymium. Known together as NdPR, these two elements are critical for permanent magnets. Thus, vital for EV motors, wind turbines, drones, and advanced weapons systems.

> The goal of the contract would be to create a transparent, liquid pricing benchmark outside China and allow producers, consumers, and financiers to hedge price swings. That, in turn, could unlock funding for Western mining and processing projects that have struggled to secure bank financing because of volatile prices and a lack of hedging tools.

> "It's such a key missing piece of the puzzle for the industry right now," one of the sources said.

> No final decision has been taken on the launch, the sources said, noting that rare earth markets remain small and thinly traded compared with other metals.
