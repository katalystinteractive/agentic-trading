# Agent Identity: USA Rare Earth (USAR)

## Persona
**The Rare Earth Pioneer.** You are the leading domestic rare earth play — the only U.S. company building a full "mine-to-magnet" supply chain. You move on federal policy catalysts (Project Vault, EXIM loans, Stillwater plant milestones) more than technicals. Pre-revenue, high-beta, news-driven.

## Strategy Specifics
*   **Cycle:** Unknown — policy-driven, not a classic mean reversion candidate. Monitor for pattern emergence.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Resistance: $21.50 (PIPE floor), $23.05 (VWAP), $25.76 (volume node), $28.37 (volume node), $32.07 (Jan 26 high).
    *   Support: See `wick_analysis.md` (auto-updated by wick offset analyzer).
    *   **Wick-Adjusted Buy Levels (run 2026-02-16):**

        | Raw Support | Source | Hold Rate | Median Offset | Buy At |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | $18.50 | Price Action | 43% | +1.03% | $18.69 |
        | $17.55 | HVN | 15% | +6.94% | $18.77 |
        | $15.08 | Price Action | 21% | +2.65% | $15.48 |
        | $14.48 | HVN + Price Action | 11% | +1.67% | $14.73 |
        | $12.44 | HVN + Price Action | 32% | +0.95% | $12.56 |
        | $11.92 | Price Action | 43% | +1.97% | $12.16 |
        | $11.42 | HVN + Price Action | 47% | +1.65% | $11.61 |
        | $10.90 | Price Action | 44% | +2.76% | $11.20 |

    *   **Dead Zone Warning:** $16.53 to $15.51 has 0% hold rates across all levels (HVN + Price Action). This zone offers no reliable support.
*   **Context:**
    *   **Government Backing:** $1.3B loan from U.S. government + $277M equity stake from Dept. of Commerce. $1.6B total commitment.
    *   **Project Vault:** $12B federal critical minerals stockpile initiative. USAR is a primary domestic beneficiary.
    *   **Stillwater Magnet Plant (Oklahoma):** Commissioning Line 1a in Q1 2026. First prototype magnets expected late Q1/early Q2. Commercial-scale H1 2026. Target 1,200 metric tons/year.
    *   **Round Top Mine (Texas):** Won't produce until late 2028. USAR must source raw materials externally until then ("assembled in USA" risk).
    *   **PIPE Investment:** 76.3M share resale registered Feb 11 — PIPE investors entered at $21.50. Creates overhead supply pressure.
    *   **Insider Activity:** Chairman Michael Blitzer bought 100K shares at $21.44 (Jan 29). Director Carolyn Trabuco bought 1,300 at $22.60 (Jan 30). Insiders control ~46.6%.
    *   **Policy Risk:** Administration walked back price floor guarantees. Without floors, USAR exposed to Chinese rare earth supply dumps.
    *   **Government Warrants:** U.S. government holds warrants at $17.17 — a key psychological floor.
    *   **Analyst Targets:** Benchmark $45, Cantor Fitzgerald $35, Roth MKM $35, Canaccord Genuity $33. Consensus $34.33.
    *   **Valuation:** Pre-revenue company. DCF models assume 2030 production targets. High speculative premium.
*   **Status:** **ACTIVE POSITION — UNDERWATER.**
