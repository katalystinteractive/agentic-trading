# Agent Memory: Applied Digital (APLD)

## Trade Log
- **2026-02-17:** Bullet 1 filled at $32.47 (3 shares). First entry on intraday dip to $32.39. Bullet 2 staged at $29.24, Bullet 3 at $27.71.

## Observations
- **2026-02-16:** Onboarded from Gemini conversation (Feb 12-13). No position — Gemini's limits at $33.55/$32.50/$31.40 never filled (market holiday Feb 12, price recovered before fills).
- Wick analysis revealed $34.07 HVN is dead (0/6 holds). First reliable support is $31.82 (4/9 holds, 44%).
- Gemini's $32.50 was remarkably close to wick-adjusted $32.47 — only $0.03 off. Credit to Gemini for that call.
- APLD dropped from $42.27 to $29.24 in one week (Feb 2-6), demonstrating the extreme volatility that makes these deeper levels realistic entry points.
- ATR 12.1% — the highest in the portfolio. Excellent mean reversion candidate but demands respect for position sizing.

## Lessons
- *Gemini can get close to correct levels intuitively, but systematic wick analysis catches the dead zones that intuition misses (e.g., $33.55 in the void above broken $34.07).*
