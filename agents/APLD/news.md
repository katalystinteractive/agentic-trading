### Deep Dive Articles

#### Analysts Raise Applied Digital (APLD) Price Targets After Q2 Results
*Source: Insider Monkey | Date: 2026-02-16 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.92)*

> Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD) is one of the15 AI Stocks That Are Skyrocketing. On January 28, Northland increased its price target on Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD) from $40 to $56 and maintained its Outperform rating on the stock.

> This update comes after “some exciting commentary” from the company’s Q2 earnings call. Applied Digital Corporation’s (NASDAQ:APLD) management pointed out that it is in advanced discussions with a new top-of-the-stack IG hyperscaler for up to three sites totaling about 900 megawatts (MW).

> Earlier, on January 8, Craig-Hallum also raised its price target on Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD) from $39 to $40 and kept its Buy rating. The firm pointed to advanced talks on three sites representing 900 MW of potential capacity, with each campus possibly expanding to 1 gigawatt (GW). Together with the existing Forge 1 and Forge 2 campuses, this could translate to 5 GW of growth capacity over the next several years.

> Craig-Hallum also noted Applied Digital Corporation’s (NASDAQ:APLD) technology investments. These include a $15 million investment in Corintis, a private firm developing liquid chip-cooling technology for AI applications, and a partnership with Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:BW).

> Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD) is a technology company that designs, develops, and operates digital infrastructure for the high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) industries.

#### APLD's Energy Strategy is Evolving: Can it Drive Further Upside?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Applied DigitalAPLD is enhancing its competitive edge by treating energy availability as a strategic asset rather than a passive input. Through its collaboration with Babcock and Wilcox Enterprises and a $15 million lead investment in Corintis, APLD is targeting two structural constraints in AI infrastructure: power deployment speed and thermal efficiency.The Babcock and Wilcox initiative is intended to accelerate on-site power generation using proven steam turbine technology for new natural gas-fired plants. With traditional gas turbines facing delivery timelines that extend into the early 2030s, this approach could shorten time-to-power for new campuses. For APLD, earlier generation availability may translate into faster lease commencements, improved utilization of contracted megawatts and stronger revenue visibility across development cycles. Meanwhile, the Corintis investment aligns with APLD's push toward higher-density AI workloads within its Polaris campuses. As customers migrate to next-generation GPUs with rising thermal intensity, cooling constraints can limit effective rack density and monetizable megawatts. If the micro-channelled cold plate systems perform as intended, APLD may be able to sustain higher compute density per building.However, both strategies involve execution complexity. Power generation projects are subject to permissions, construction timelines and utility coordination, while advanced cooling platforms must demonstrate performance consistency at hyperscale. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal third-quarter revenues is pegged at $75.06 million, up 41.83% year over year. Whether APLD's strategic approach to energy as a competitive differentiator translates into sustained financial outperformance will depend on how effectively these power and cooling initiatives convert into operational megawatts and lease revenues.

> Applied Digital competes withVertiv HoldingsVRT andnVent ElectricNVT in addressing power constraints for AI infrastructure. Vertiv provides power delivery and backup systems that enable higher-density deployments for hyperscale customers, while nVent Electric supplies power distribution and thermal management components across data center operators. Both Vertiv and nVent Electric serve multiple customers through equipment sales, spreading technology risk across deployments. Applied Digital's direct ownership of power infrastructure through strategic partnerships aims to accelerate campus energization timelines. However, Vertiv's and nVent Electric's vendor model requires less capital per megawatt than Applied Digital's integrated campus approach, which concentrates both power deployment risk and control at the site level.

> Applied Digital shares have jumped 148.6% in the past six months, outperforming the broader Zacks Finance sector’s return of 4.6% and the Zacks Financial-Miscellaneous Services industry’s decline of 27.1%.

> Applied Digital stock is overvalued, with a forward 12-month price/sales of 21.62X compared with the broader sector’s 9.23X. APLD has a Value Score of F.

> The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fiscal 2026 loss is pegged at 10 cents per share, widening by 3 cents over the past 30 days. Applied Digital reported a loss of 16 cents per share in the previous year.

#### IREN Aims for $3.4B AI Cloud ARR by 2026: Can it Hit the Target?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-11 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.97)*

> IREN LimitedIREN is aiming to reach $3.4 billion in annualized run-rate revenues (ARR) by the end of 2026, mainly from its AI cloud business. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, IREN reported around $2.3 billion of ARR under contract, which includes its large AI cloud agreement with Microsoft and about $0.4-$0.5 billion of ARR from the Prince George site. This shows that the company already has a strong base to start from.

> In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, IREN secured $3.6 billion in GPU financing and received $1.9 billion from Microsoft in customer prepayments, which together cover about 95% of the GPU-related capital spending tied to the Microsoft contract. Management said this reduces risk and allows the company to focus on adding more customers.

> Another positive is power availability. In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, IREN stated that it has more than 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of secured power, which management said is hard to find in the current data center market and reaching its $3.4 billion ARR target by the end of 2026 would use only about 10% of this power. This means most of the power capacity is still available for future growth, which should support the company’s plans to deploy around 140,000 GPUs by the end of 2026.

> The above-mentioned shows that the company remains well-positioned to reach the $3.4 billion ARR target by the end of 2026. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IREN's fiscal 2026 revenues is pegged at $1.01 billion, suggesting a year-over-year increase of 98.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IREN's fiscal 2027 revenues is pegged at $2.76 billion, indicating a year-over-year increase of 172.6%.

> IREN faces intense competition fromApplied DigitalAPLD andTeraWulfWULF in the AI infrastructure space.

#### APLD Trades Near 52-Week High: Should You Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-10 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Applied DigitalAPLD shares closed at $38.26 on Monday (Feb. 09), 9.5% below the 52-week high of $42.27 it hit on Jan. 28, 2026. APLD shares have jumped 172.7% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Finance sector's 9.3% increase and the Financial – Miscellaneous Services industry’s 23.4% decline. The stock has also far outpaced peers, withRiot Platforms' RIOT shares advancing 34.8% andEquinix's EQIX shares appreciating 10.4% over the same period.The rally in APLD shares stems primarily from the company's success in securing substantial hyperscale data center leases that validate its business model transformation.

> APLD's long-term revenue outlook is underpinned by $16 billion in prospective lease revenues secured across 600 megawatts with investment-grade hyperscalers, includingCoreWeaveCRWV. The CoreWeave agreement encompasses 400 megawatts at Polaris Forge 1, representing $11 billion in committed revenue over 15 years. The first 100-megawatt building is currently operational and generating lease income. APLD reported $12 million in recognized lease revenues during the second quarter as CoreWeave's lease commenced partway through the quarter.

> This marks the critical transition from pure development to recurring revenue generation. An additional 200-megawatt lease at Polaris Forge 2 with a separate investment-grade hyperscaler contributes $5 billion in prospective revenue. This demonstrates APLD's ability to replicate its contracted model across multiple campuses. APLD expects lease revenues to ramp substantially over the next 18 to 24 months as additional buildings achieve operational status through 2027.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for APLD’s fiscal 2026 loss is pegged at 36 cents per share, widening by 6 cents over the past 30 days. The figure indicates an improvement of 55% from the loss reported in fiscal 2025.

> Applied Digital Corporation price-consensus-chart - Applied Digital Corporation Quote

> APLD concluded the second quarter with $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents against $2.6 billion in debt, providing substantial liquidity for capital-intensive expansion plans. The Macquarie Asset Management financing framework offers access to $4.1 billion in remaining preferred equity capacity, enabling large-scale project funding while APLD retains over 85% ownership at the site level. This structure limits equity dilution for existing shareholders. The company completed a $2.35 billion offering of 9.25% senior secured notes due 2030 during the quarter, with most debt maturing in 2030 and minimizing near-term refinancing risk.

#### Should You Buy, Sell or Hold IREN Stock Post Q2 Earnings?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-09 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> IREN LimitedIREN shares are up 5.1% since the company reported its second-quarter fiscal 2026 results on Feb. 5. The surge in share price can be attributed to strong momentum in IREN’s AI Cloud Business, which increased 136.9% on a sequential basis to $17.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2026, up from prior quarter’s $7.3 million.
