#### NVIDIA vs IonQ: Can Quantum Replicate AI's $4 Trillion Giant in 2026?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-17 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Since the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT, trained on more than 10,000NVIDIANVDA GPUs, AI infrastructure demand has accelerated at an unprecedented pace, propelling NVIDIA to the center of the compute economy. The stock has risen more than 1300% since 2022 October and now commands over $4.4 trillion in market capitalization, with multiple sources stating that NVIDIA controls more than 80% of the AI chip market. In its last reported, third quarter of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA reported $57 billion in revenue (up 62% year over year), including $51.2 billion from data center, as hyperscaler CapEx expectations for 2026 climbed to roughly $600 billion. Visibility into $0.5 trillion of Blackwell and Rubin revenues through 2026 underscores the scale of the AI buildout.

> In contrast, quantum computing entered the investment limelight in 2023, with momentum accelerating through 2024-2025.IonQIONQ has gained 889% over the past three years, supported by 222% revenue growth in the third quarter of 2025 to $39.9 million, a record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity and a strengthened $3.5 billion cash position. As governments and enterprises explore quantum advantage use cases, investors are asking whether IonQ can replicate NVIDIA’s platform-driven dominance this time in a new computing paradigm.

> Over the past three and a half years, NVIDIA has delivered a remarkable growth trajectory backed by strong strategic execution, product growth and strong capital markets performance. Since the 2022 launch of ChatGPT, demand for accelerated computing has surged stupendously. In the most recent quarter, NVDA generated revenues from data center, highlighting robust secular demand across cloud hyperscalers, enterprise AI workloads and foundational model training cycles. In the third quarter of fiscal 2026, NVIDIA generated and $31.9 billion in net income, with GAAP gross margins of 73.4%. Operating cash flow exceeded $23.8 billion and free cash flow reached approximately $22.1 billion, indicating a robust capital structure. This financial strength supports aggressive R&D investment and multi-generation platform transitions from Ampere to Blackwell and Rubin.

> By contrast, IonQ is still in the early stages of commercial growth but has shown accelerating momentum that aligns with long-term expansion goals. The company’s third-quarter 2025 revenues exceeded guidance by 37%. The company has raised significant capital, resulting in a $2 billion equity offering that boosted pro-forma cash to $3.5 billion, providing a strong balance sheet to invest in R&D, acquisitions and platform scaling. Strategic moves such as the acquisition of Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic and more recently the announced $1.8 billion SkyWater Technology deal to internalize semiconductor fabrication, strengthen IonQ’s technology stack across computing, networking and sensing.

> Looking ahead, IonQ’s ability to build sustained momentum depends on continued technical execution and broader market adoption. Unlike GPUs, where demand is already well established across hyperscalers and enterprise workloads, commercial quantum computing remains nascent and concentrated in early enterprise and government contracts. IonQ’s third-quarter 2025 milestones, including 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity and expanded algorithmic qubit performance, along with strategic acquisitions like Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic, strengthen its long-term platform position. With a strong cash balance and no debt, IonQ can continue investing in R&D and expanding its platform. However, broader revenue scaling and profitability are likely tied to future deployments of larger-scale, fault-tolerant systems and wider industry adoption, a multi-year journey compared with NVIDIA’s current commercial footprint.

#### Quantum Speed Technology Targeting Multi-Trillion-Dollar Infrastructure Efficiency Opportunity
*Source: PR Newswire | Date: 2026-02-17 | Sentiment: Positive (+1.00)*

> Advanced computing power positions companies to unlock cost savings across global energy, transportation, and logistics networks

> NEW YORK,Feb. 17, 2026/PRNewswire/ --Market News UpdatesNews Commentary-Quantum speed is all about solving really big problems much faster than traditional computers. For large-scale infrastructure — think power grids, transportation systems, or supply chains — there are millions of data points and interconnected moving parts. Classical computers can tackle this complexity, but it often takes a long time. Quantum-powered systems, by contrast, can evaluate many possibilities at once, helping planners and operators find smarter solutions in a fraction of the time. This can lead to smoother traffic flows, better energy balancing, quicker risk responses, and overall more reliable infrastructure performance.   Active Companies in quantum speed space include:VisionWave Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ: VWAV),Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT),IonQ(NYSE: IONQ),Rigetti Computing, Inc.(NASDAQ: RGTI) andD-Wave Quantum Inc.(NYSE: QBTS).

> What makes this even more exciting for the market is the growth potential. Analysts forecast that the global quantum computing market could expand from just over a billion dollars today to tens of billions within the next decade, with somereportsprojecting values north of $20 billion by 2030 and even larger figures through the 2030s as more industries adopt the technology. That means companies building quantum-enabled optimization tools aren't just solving hard problems — they're positioning themselves in a rapidly expanding market where faster, smarter insights translate directly into cost savings and competitive advantage.

> Quantum speed is also becoming a serious competitive edge in large-scalecryptomining operations. Mining facilities manage thousands—sometimes tens of thousands—of machines running 24/7, all competing to solve complex cryptographic problems as efficiently as possible. Traditional optimization tools can analyze energy loads, cooling systems, hash rate performance, and uptime metrics—but often with delays. Quantum-enhanced optimization has the potential to process massive datasets simultaneously, helping operators dynamically allocate power, optimize hardware performance, and adjust workloads in real time. In an industry where milliseconds and energy efficiency directly impact profitability, faster optimization can translate into stronger margins.

> VisionWave (NASDAQ: VWAV) Enters into $10 Million Statement of Work for Development of qSpeed-Mine™ - Mining Acceleration Platform -VisionWave Holdings Inc.($VWAV) ("VisionWave" or the "Company") today announced the execution of a $10 million Statement of Work (SOW) with a third-party vendor to develop, validate, and deploy a custom qSpeed-Mine™cryptocurrencymining acceleration and orchestration platform.
