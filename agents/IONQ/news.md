#### Quantum Speed Technology Targeting Multi-Trillion-Dollar Infrastructure Efficiency Opportunity
*Source: PR Newswire | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+1.00)*

> Advanced computing power positions companies to unlock cost savings across global energy, transportation, and logistics networks

> NEW YORK,Feb. 17, 2026/PRNewswire/ --Market News UpdatesNews Commentary-Quantum speed is all about solving really big problems much faster than traditional computers. For large-scale infrastructure — think power grids, transportation systems, or supply chains — there are millions of data points and interconnected moving parts. Classical computers can tackle this complexity, but it often takes a long time. Quantum-powered systems, by contrast, can evaluate many possibilities at once, helping planners and operators find smarter solutions in a fraction of the time. This can lead to smoother traffic flows, better energy balancing, quicker risk responses, and overall more reliable infrastructure performance.   Active Companies in quantum speed space include:VisionWave Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ: VWAV),Quantum Computing Inc.(NASDAQ: QUBT),IonQ(NYSE: IONQ),Rigetti Computing, Inc.(NASDAQ: RGTI) andD-Wave Quantum Inc.(NYSE: QBTS).

> What makes this even more exciting for the market is the growth potential. Analysts forecast that the global quantum computing market could expand from just over a billion dollars today to tens of billions within the next decade, with somereportsprojecting values north of $20 billion by 2030 and even larger figures through the 2030s as more industries adopt the technology. That means companies building quantum-enabled optimization tools aren't just solving hard problems — they're positioning themselves in a rapidly expanding market where faster, smarter insights translate directly into cost savings and competitive advantage.

> Quantum speed is also becoming a serious competitive edge in large-scalecryptomining operations. Mining facilities manage thousands—sometimes tens of thousands—of machines running 24/7, all competing to solve complex cryptographic problems as efficiently as possible. Traditional optimization tools can analyze energy loads, cooling systems, hash rate performance, and uptime metrics—but often with delays. Quantum-enhanced optimization has the potential to process massive datasets simultaneously, helping operators dynamically allocate power, optimize hardware performance, and adjust workloads in real time. In an industry where milliseconds and energy efficiency directly impact profitability, faster optimization can translate into stronger margins.

> VisionWave (NASDAQ: VWAV) Enters into $10 Million Statement of Work for Development of qSpeed-Mine™ - Mining Acceleration Platform -VisionWave Holdings Inc.($VWAV) ("VisionWave" or the "Company") today announced the execution of a $10 million Statement of Work (SOW) with a third-party vendor to develop, validate, and deploy a custom qSpeed-Mine™cryptocurrencymining acceleration and orchestration platform.

#### Beyond NVIDIA: 4 AI & Quantum Plays Aiming Big Platform Upside in 2026
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-16 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Most investors in 2026 agree on one thing- putting money into established AI leaders is the clearest way to tap into the ongoing tech boom. Companies such asNVIDIANVDA continue to benefit directly from hyperscaler and enterprise AI infrastructure spending. Zacks Consensus Estimates points to fiscal 2026 revenue near $213 billion, supported by next-generation GPU platforms and a deeply embedded software ecosystem. Multi-billion-dollar AI data center expansions by major cloud providers reinforce demand visibility.

> The debate now is where incremental capital should flow - toward emerging AI players with accelerating monetization, or toward speculative quantum computing firms offering asymmetric upside. In this article, we examine two AI-focused names —SoundHound AISOUN andMarvellMRVL, along with 2 quantum computing stocksIonQIONQ andD-Wave QuantumQBTS. Together, they represent distinct risk-reward pathways across AI software, AI semiconductor infrastructure and next-generation computing architectures.

> On the AI side, SoundHound AI and Marvell offer exposure to two different layers of the AI value chain with measurable growth trajectories.

> SoundHound AI’s recent results show strong top-line momentum, with the last-reported third quarter 2025 revenue of up 68% year over year and 2025 guidance implying nearly 98% annual growth, albeit from a small base and with continued net losses as it invests in monetization and scaling products like its Amelia agentic AI platform. In 2026, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is expected to report earnings growth of 56.9% on revenue growth of 38.3%.

> Marvell’s infrastructure-focused model demonstrates much larger scale and robust demand from AI data centers, reporting $2.006 billion in revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, up 58% year over year, with its data center segment alone accounting for roughly 74% of total revenue driven by custom AI silicon and high-bandwidth interconnect products tied to hyperscaler deployments. Marvell’s figures reflect firm scale and AI-driven revenue concentration, offering investors a contrast between early-stage AI software expansion and established AI infrastructure success within the broader ecosystem. In its fiscal 2027 (ending Jan 2027), this Zacks Rank #3 stock is expected to report earnings growth of 23.3% on revenue growth of 22.8%.

#### IonQ, Kyndryl, Diebold Nixdorf, Ibotta, and SAIC Stocks Trade Up, What You Need To Know
*Source: StockStory | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.92)*

> A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in softer than anticipated, fueling investor optimism for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that prices rose 0.2% from December to January, below the 0.3% forecast. On an annual basis, inflation moderated to 2.4%, under the expected 2.5%. This cooling trend has significant implications for monetary policy, with investors now increasing bets on multiple rate reductions by the end of the year. The news prompted a rally in both stocks and Treasuries, as lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs for companies and can stimulate economic activity. The Russell 2000 index, which consists of smaller companies sensitive to domestic economic conditions and financial costs, saw a particularly strong positive reaction.

> The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

> Among others, the following stocks were impacted:

> IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 90 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

#### Does Rigetti's $600M Cash Runway De-Risk Its 2026 Roadmap Execution?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Rigetti ComputingRGTI moves into 2026 with one of the strongest balance sheets in the pure-play quantum universe, a position that materially differentiates it from peers still dependent on frequent capital raises. Liquidity now exceeds $600 million, supported by warrant exercises completed during the second half of 2025, giving the company multi-year financial visibility. This war chest meaningfully lowers near-term dilution risk and allows Rigetti to pursue its roadmap without compromising timelines to preserve cash. Management has reiterated that current resources are sufficient to fund planned system launches, including next-generation 100+ qubit platforms with approximately 99.5% fidelity and a higher-performance 150+ qubit architecture expected as commercialization efforts extend into 2026.

> That financial flexibility is particularly important given the inherently uneven nature of Rigetti’s revenue profile, which remains tied largely to government agencies, national labs and research institutions. Recent contract momentum, including expanded international engagement and on-premise system demand, reinforces long-term relevance but does little to smooth quarterly volatility. Against that backdrop, liquidity acts as a strategic buffer, allowing Rigetti to absorb delayed deployments, roadmap recalibration and customer-specific customization without resorting to external financing. In an industry where execution timelines frequently slip, balance sheet strength has become a competitive asset rather than a footnote.

> Taken together, Rigetti’s 2026 setup appears financially equipped to sustain elevated R&D intensity, support manufacturing scale-up and weather revenue lumpiness, all without tapping capital markets.

> D-Wave QuantumQBTS recently marked a major technical milestone by demonstrating scalable on-chip cryogenic control for gate-model quantum processors, addressing a core bottleneck in building large-scale systems. The breakthrough sharply reduces wiring complexity without compromising fidelity and, importantly, leverages the same cryogenic control technology already proven in D-Wave’s commercial annealing platforms. This validates the company’s cross-platform engineering strategy and supports its push toward an initial gate-model system, while continued uptake of Advantage-class annealing systems highlights growing commercial relevance alongside technical progress.

> IonQIONQ has deepened its relationship with Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information through plans to install a next-generation 100-qubit IonQ Tempo system at South Korea’s National Quantum Computing Center of Excellence. The system will be integrated with KISTI’s KISTI-6 supercomputer, enabling the country’s first on-premises hybrid quantum–classical computing environment. For investors, the move highlights IonQ’s increasing success with government-backed institutions and its ability to embed quantum hardware within national HPC infrastructure, strengthening its role as a long-term partner as sovereign quantum investments accelerate.
