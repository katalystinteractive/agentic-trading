#### IonQ, Kyndryl, Diebold Nixdorf, Ibotta, and SAIC Stocks Trade Up, What You Need To Know
*Source: StockStory | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.92)*

> A number of stocks jumped in the afternoon session after the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report came in softer than anticipated, fueling investor optimism for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that prices rose 0.2% from December to January, below the 0.3% forecast. On an annual basis, inflation moderated to 2.4%, under the expected 2.5%. This cooling trend has significant implications for monetary policy, with investors now increasing bets on multiple rate reductions by the end of the year. The news prompted a rally in both stocks and Treasuries, as lower interest rates typically reduce borrowing costs for companies and can stimulate economic activity. The Russell 2000 index, which consists of smaller companies sensitive to domestic economic conditions and financial costs, saw a particularly strong positive reaction.

> The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

> Among others, the following stocks were impacted:

> IonQ’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 90 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

#### Does Rigetti's $600M Cash Runway De-Risk Its 2026 Roadmap Execution?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Rigetti ComputingRGTI moves into 2026 with one of the strongest balance sheets in the pure-play quantum universe, a position that materially differentiates it from peers still dependent on frequent capital raises. Liquidity now exceeds $600 million, supported by warrant exercises completed during the second half of 2025, giving the company multi-year financial visibility. This war chest meaningfully lowers near-term dilution risk and allows Rigetti to pursue its roadmap without compromising timelines to preserve cash. Management has reiterated that current resources are sufficient to fund planned system launches, including next-generation 100+ qubit platforms with approximately 99.5% fidelity and a higher-performance 150+ qubit architecture expected as commercialization efforts extend into 2026.

> That financial flexibility is particularly important given the inherently uneven nature of Rigetti’s revenue profile, which remains tied largely to government agencies, national labs and research institutions. Recent contract momentum, including expanded international engagement and on-premise system demand, reinforces long-term relevance but does little to smooth quarterly volatility. Against that backdrop, liquidity acts as a strategic buffer, allowing Rigetti to absorb delayed deployments, roadmap recalibration and customer-specific customization without resorting to external financing. In an industry where execution timelines frequently slip, balance sheet strength has become a competitive asset rather than a footnote.

> Taken together, Rigetti’s 2026 setup appears financially equipped to sustain elevated R&D intensity, support manufacturing scale-up and weather revenue lumpiness, all without tapping capital markets.

> D-Wave QuantumQBTS recently marked a major technical milestone by demonstrating scalable on-chip cryogenic control for gate-model quantum processors, addressing a core bottleneck in building large-scale systems. The breakthrough sharply reduces wiring complexity without compromising fidelity and, importantly, leverages the same cryogenic control technology already proven in D-Wave’s commercial annealing platforms. This validates the company’s cross-platform engineering strategy and supports its push toward an initial gate-model system, while continued uptake of Advantage-class annealing systems highlights growing commercial relevance alongside technical progress.

> IonQIONQ has deepened its relationship with Korea Institute of Science and Technology Information through plans to install a next-generation 100-qubit IonQ Tempo system at South Korea’s National Quantum Computing Center of Excellence. The system will be integrated with KISTI’s KISTI-6 supercomputer, enabling the country’s first on-premises hybrid quantum–classical computing environment. For investors, the move highlights IonQ’s increasing success with government-backed institutions and its ability to embed quantum hardware within national HPC infrastructure, strengthening its role as a long-term partner as sovereign quantum investments accelerate.

#### IonQ, Inc. (IONQ) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-13 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> IonQ, Inc.(IONQ) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

> Shares of this company have returned -34.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2% change. The Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, to which IonQ belongs, has gained 3.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

> While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

> Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

> Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.

#### IonQ's Quantum M&A Push and $3.5B Cash: Buy, Sell or Hold in 2026?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-12 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> IonQ’s IONQ shares have fallen 25.1% in the first one-and-a-half months of 2026, sharply underperforming the broader industry’s roughly 11% gain. Yet the company’s recent strategic actions indicate that its business trajectory remains firmly expansionary.

> Technologically, the company achieved an AQ 64 on its fifth-generation Tempo system and a world-record 99.99% two-qubit gate fidelity milestone, while advancing integration of Oxford Ionics’ electronic qubit control architecture. At the same time, IonQ’s M&A strategy has materially reshaped its profile. The additions of Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic expanded its reach across computing, networking, sensing and security. The proposed $1.8 billion acquisition of SkyWater is designed to vertically integrate semiconductor manufacturing, shorten design-to-fabrication cycles and accelerate scaling toward larger qubit systems.

> In the third quarter of 2025, IonQ completed the acquisitions of Oxford Ionics and Vector Atomic, expanding beyond computing into electronic qubit control, sensing and security. Oxford Ionics’ EQC (Electronic Qubit Control) architecture is being integrated into IonQ’s 256-qubit system targeted for 2026, while Vector Atomic adds advanced atomic clocks and sensing technologies with existing U.S. government programs. These additions supported IonQ’s platform expansion in the third quarter, when it delivered 222% year-over-year growth and reported 37% above the high end of guidance, prompting an increase in full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $106–$110 million.

> The proposed $1.8 billion acquisition of SkyWater represents a further step toward vertical integration, embedding semiconductor design, fabrication and packaging within IonQ’s ecosystem. Management expects this to cut the 256-qubit chip design-to-sample cycle from nine months to two months and enable the first 200,000-qubit chips to return from the fab in 2028, potentially accelerating fault-tolerant timelines.

> Importantly, IonQ ended October with a pro-forma cash balance of $3.5 billion and no debt, making it one of the best-capitalized pure-play quantum companies. This strong financial position provides the flexibility to pursue and integrate strategic acquisitions, supporting long-term growth prospects.
