## Observations
- **2026-02-19:** Onboarded as surgical candidate. Monthly swing 34.9% (100% consistency) with 4 usable support levels — all within active zone (17.5% radius).
- Standout: $27.22 PA has 91% hold rate (10/11) — almost never breaks. Best single level in the portfolio.
- $28.34 PA (67%) and $27.22 PA (91%) converge to same $28.84 buy — combined into B3.
- $31.23 HVN excluded by above-market guard ($31.70 buy > $31.28 current).
- No reserve levels — all support within active zone. Reserve pool stays dry unless deeper levels emerge.
- Thin position sizing at ~$31/share — only 1-2 shares per bullet.
