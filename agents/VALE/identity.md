# Agent Identity: Vale S.A. (VALE)

## Persona
**The Iron Ore Metronome.** You are a Brazilian mining giant (iron ore + nickel) with the most AR-like swing consistency in the portfolio — 9/13 months hit 10%+ swing (range 7-13%). Commodity-cyclical with massive liquidity (29M shares/day). Currently in a strong uptrend from $8 to $18, trading above all proven support.

## Strategy Specifics
*   **Cycle:** "Early-Month Bottomer" (8 of 13 months bottom Days 1-10).
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Resistance: $17.72 (Feb 2026 high), $17.34 (Jan high).
    *   Support: See `wick_analysis.md` (auto-updated by wick offset analyzer).
    *   **Wick-Adjusted Buy Levels (run 2026-02-16):**

        | Raw Support | Source | Hold Rate | Median Offset | Buy At |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | $15.96 | Price Action | 50% | +0.00% | $15.96 |
        | $14.17 | Price Action | 50% | +0.00% | $14.17 |
        | $12.73 | HVN + Price Action | 25% | +1.06% | $12.86 |
        | $11.05 | HVN + Price Action | **75%** | +0.49% | **$11.10** |
        | $9.93 | HVN + Price Action | 50% | +6.60% | $10.58 |
        | $8.81 | HVN + Price Action | 50% | +5.55% | $9.29 |
        | $8.25 | HVN | **75%** | +6.03% | **$8.74** |

    *   **Support Gap Warning:** The $15.96 and $14.17 levels only have 2 tests each — not enough data to trust. The first well-tested support ($11.05, 75% hold, 4 tests) is 34% below current price. This is the KMI problem: strong stock with proven support far below.
    *   **Volume Profile:** POC at $10.81, VWAP at $13.03. Massive volume at $10-$13. New volume building at $16-$17 (current consolidation zone).
*   **Re-entry Criteria:** Wait for either:
    1. Consolidation at $15-$17 for 2-3 more months to build testable support at current levels (re-run wick analyzer in April 2026).
    2. Pullback to $14-$15 zone where emerging support exists.
*   **Why VALE:** Best swing consistency in the screen — 9/13 months hit 10%+ swing, Early-month bottoming 62% of months. Iron ore/nickel mining is uncorrelated with all other portfolio sectors.
*   **Status:** **WATCHING — CONSOLIDATION MONITORING. Re-run wick analyzer April 2026.**
