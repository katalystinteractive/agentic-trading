Antimony oxide is used to form a flame-retardant system for plastics, rubber, fiberglass, textile goods, paints, coatings, and paper, as a color fastener in paint, and as a phosphorescent agent in fluorescent light bulbs. Antimony metal is used in bearings, storage batteries, and ordnance. Antimony trisulfide is used as a primer in ammunition. The Company also recovers precious metals, primarily gold and silver, at its Montana facility from third party ore. At its Bear River Zeolite ("BRZ") facility located in Idaho, the Company mines and processes zeolite, a group of industrial minerals used in water filtration, sewage treatment, nuclear waste and other environmental cleanup, odor control, gas separation, animal nutrition, soil amendment and fertilizer, and other miscellaneous applications. During 2024 and 2025, the Company began acquiring mining claims and leases located in Montana, Alaska and Ontario, Canada in an effort to expand its operations as well as its product offerings.

#### The $30 Billion Shift: Critical Minerals Enter a New Era
*Source: PR Newswire | Date: 2026-02-09 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.80)*

> VANCOUVER, BC,Feb. 9, 2026/PRNewswire/ --USA News GroupNews Commentary– China just flipped the table on global procurement. By locking down exports on silver, tungsten, and antimony, they signaled a strategic shift that is reshaping Western defense priorities[1]. The response was immediate: the U.S. Government mobilized over $30 billion in diverse funding to secure critical mineral supply chains, establishing allied jurisdiction deposits as the primary hedge against supply disruption[2]. This structural pivot elevates dual-commodity discoveries in stable regimes, positioningRUA GOLD Inc.(TSXV: RUA) (OTCQB: NZAUF),Perpetua Resources(NASDAQ: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA),United States Antimony(NYSE-A: UAMY),Eldorado Gold(NYSE: EGO) (TSX: ELD), andForan Mining(TSX: FOM) (OTCQX: FMCXF)within a narrowing window where defense-critical utility commands acquisition premiums far exceeding traditional gold valuations.

> Mining and metals M&A in 2026 centers on consolidation and supply chain security[3], while bilateral critical minerals frameworks signed in February 2026 establish the groundwork for nations to collaborate on pricing and financing for secure projects[2]. Capital allocation now favors polymetallic systems where geopolitical necessity intersects with proven geology, transforming once-marginal antimony credits into strategic assets that justify sector-leading takeover multiples.

> RUA GOLD Inc.(TSXV: RUA) (OTCQB: NZAUF) just laid outan aggressive 2026 game planthat puts four drill rigs to work across New Zealand's historic Reefton Goldfield while simultaneously pushing toward mine permitting under the country's new fast-track legislation.

> The company now holds C$38 million in cash following an oversubscribed financing in January, giving it one of the strongest treasuries among junior gold explorers operating in the South Pacific. That war chest is funding a four-rig drill campaign at the Reefton Project on the South Island, where recent results at the Auld Creek target confirmed a major high-grade gold-antimony system. Drill hole ACDDH050 intersected3.0m at 21.27 g/t AuEq(4.5 g/t Au and 3.9% antimony) from 137 meters depth, extending the deposit strike length to 870 meters with mineralization still open in every direction.

> For anyone unfamiliar with the significance: antimony is a critical mineral used in military ammunition, flame retardants, and battery technology. China controls roughly 60% of global supply and has been tightening export controls, which means Western governments are actively hunting for new sources. New Zealandformally designated antimony as critical, which positions RUA GOLD at the center of this supply chain scramble.
