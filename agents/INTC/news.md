#### 1 Semiconductor Stock to Target This Week and 2 We Turn Down
*Source: StockStory | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.94)*

> Semiconductors are the core infrastructure powering the Information Age. The way we live and work is also changing with AI, which is creating secular demand for more powerful chips. 
As a result, the industry has seen solid stock price performance over the last six months as its gain of 62% has outpaced the S&P 500’s 7.6% return.

> Nevertheless, a cautious approach is imperative because Moore’s Law (a principle stating that computer productivity doubles every two years) will eventually make even the most impactful technologies today obsolete. With that said, here is one semiconductor stock poised to generate sustainable market-beating returns and two we’re steering clear of.

> Inventor of the x86 processor that powered decades of technological innovation in PCs, data centers, and numerous other markets, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leading manufacturer of computer processors and graphics chips.

> Intel’s stock price of $44.57 implies a valuation ratio of 100.4x forward P/E.Read our free research report to see why you should think twice about including INTC in your portfolio.

> Spun out of Motorola in 1999 and built through a series of acquisitions, onsemi (NASDAQ:ON) is a global provider of analog chips specializing in autos, industrial applications, and power management in cloud data centers.

#### NVIDIA's 13F Bombshell: A New AI Power Trio Emerges
*Source: MarketBeat | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> The world’s most valuable company just made some headline-grabbing news.Semiconductor giantNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA)has released its latest 13F SEC filing, detailing the investments the company made and sold during Q4 2025. As the firm leading the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom, investors watch NVIDIA's trades closely.

> The filing not only indicates which stocks NVIDIA may see value in, but also highlights its strategic moves within the AI and semiconductor ecosystem. While NVIDIA announced many of these trades in advance of its 13F release, investors were not aware of all of them until now. The clearest takeaway from the 13F is where NVIDIA added exposure, where it exited, and what it chose not to change.

> Three new names showed up on NVIDIA’s latest 13F filing:Intel (NASDAQ: INTC),Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS)andNokia (NYSE: NOK). The company announced these investments in several press releases during 2025, but they are still worth examining.

> Intel is now NVIDIA’s largest holding. At the end of Q4, it held over214 million Intel shares, valued at approximately $7.9 billion. This represents around 61% of the firm’s overall public equity portfolio. NVIDIA revealed this investment inSeptember of 2025, initiating a $5 billion purchase at $23.28 per share. Since then, Intel stock is up nearly 50%, benefiting from a 23% spike immediately after NVIDIA’s press release.

> Synopsys is one of the world’s two giants in the electronic design automation industry. This software is essential to designing highly advanced chips. Synopsys also owns key intellectual property that serves as “building blocks” in semiconductor design. NVIDIA owns over 4.8 million Synopsys shares valued at over $2.2 billion at the end of Q4. Synopsys is up over 5% since NVIDIA announced its $2 billion purchase inDecember of 2025at $414.79 per share.

#### ETFs to Gain as Japan Pledges to Invest $36B in U.S. Projects
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> In a significant diplomatic and economic move, Japan recently announced a pledge to invest $36 billion in three massive U.S. energy and manufacturing projects. This "first tranche" is part of a broader $550 billion commitment from Tokyo aimed at rebuilding the American industrial base while securing critical supply chains for Japan.

> The $36 billion investment package centers on a giant 9.2-gigawatt (GW) capacity gas-fired power plant in Ohio, a deepwater crude export terminal off Texas and a synthetic industrial diamond facility in Georgia, thereby targeting three strategic industries: natural gas power generation, energy export infrastructure and critical mineral manufacturing.

> For the U.S. companies directly operating the aforementioned projects as well as those supplying critical inputs to these facilities, the influx of capital from Japan promises new growth opportunities, expanded operations and potential revenue streams. For investors, this creates an opportune moment to gain exposure to the benefits of this investment framework through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with significant exposure to the beneficiary companies.

> As we delve into the specific industries and corporations poised to gain from this landmark investment plan, in the next section, a clearer picture should emerge of which funds are best positioned to ride this wave of economic activity.

> Since Japan’s initial $36 billion tranche is concentrated in three flagship U.S. projects, here’s a breakdown of the industries and companies associated with these projects and thus are likely to see a direct or indirect benefit:

*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-19 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Chicago, IL – February 19, 2026 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, Bloom Energy BE, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT, Amazon AMZN, Intel INTC, Nebius NBIS and Micron MU.

> A 13F disclosure is a quarterly report that institutional investors with $100 million or more in assets under management (AUM) must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) each quarter. 13F filings give investors a rare glimpse into what the smartest, largest, and most successful investors are investing their money in. Included in the 13F report is the name of the security, the type of security (for example, call option or equity), the number of shares or contracts held, the fair market value of the position, and the percentage of portfolio the position comprises.

> These reports are required to be filed within 45 days of the end of each calendar quarter. The deadline for Q4 2025 was Tuesday, February 17th, meaning that all the big investors have filed their 13F reports. While 13Fs can represent “stale data” they can provide investors with valuable transparency and an idea of what the big institutional investors are seeing. With the AI boom in full swing and the fastest-growing industry on Wall Street, I will focus today’s commentary on five of the most interesting AI-related purchases by Wall Street juggernauts, including

> Stanley Druckenmiller is known as the most consistent big money manager on Wall Street. Shortly after the release of ChatGPT, Druckenmiller purchasedNvidia, making billions of dollars on the trade. Later, he scored wins in other AI-related firms likeTaiwan Semiconductor. According to his latest 13F, Druckenmiller is making a $64 million bet onBloom Energy.

> The bet makes sense. With AI data center demand accelerating exponentially, energy will need to follow suit. Bloom Energy helpds big tech companies power their data centers through its technology that converts fuelse such as natural gas and hydrogen into reliable electricity without combustion, offering high efficiency and low emissions.
