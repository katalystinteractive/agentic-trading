#### Amkor Trades Near 52-Week High: Buy, Sell or Hold the Stock?
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Amkor TechnologyAMKR shares closed at $47.48 on Friday, Feb. 13, down 16.8% from the 52-week high of $57.09 reached on Feb. 11, 2026. AMKR shares have jumped 97.4% in the past six months, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 7.8% and the Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors industry's 19.8% growth.The stock has underperformed its peer,ASE TechnologyASX, whose shares have surged 131.7% over the same period, while tracking close toIntelINTC, up 97.8%, and outpacingTaiwan SemiconductorTSM, which has surged 51.8%.The rally has been driven by accelerating demand for advanced packaging tied to AI and high-performance computing, particularly the ramp of AMKR’s High Density Fan Out (HDFO) platform for data center and CPU programs.

> AMKR delivered a strong fourth quarter, with net sales of $1.89 billion rising 16% year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.35%. EPS of 69 cents surpassed the consensus mark by 60.5%. The upside reflects higher advanced packaging revenue, particularly in communications, where stronger iOS demand contributed meaningfully. The mix shift toward advanced products supported gross margin expansion to 16.7%, though approximately $30 million in one-time asset sale proceeds supported gross profit. For 2025, AMKR reported sales of $6.71 billion, up 6% year over year, reflecting steady progress in computing and automotive alongside stabilization in communications.For the fiscal first-quarter, AMKR expects sales between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, implying 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Gross margin is projected between 12.5% and 13.5%, reflecting normalization following the fourth-quarter asset sale benefit. Excluding that item, the underlying margin profile appears stable. AMKR anticipated capital expenditure of $2.5 billion to $3 billion in 2026 compared with $905 million in 2025. The increase is tied to Phase 1 construction of the Arizona facility and HDFO capacity expansion in Korea. While this elevated spending may increase execution risk, it is aimed at expanding advanced packaging capacity to support anticipated demand in AI and data center programs. Returns will depend on utilization levels and program ramp timing.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AMKOR’s first-quarter EPS is pegged at 23 cents, up by 21.1% over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a year-over-year improvement of 155.56%.

> Amkor Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart - Amkor Technology, Inc. Quote

> Amkor has positioned computing as its primary growth engine for 2026, targeting over 20% year-on-year expansion in that segment. Two new central processing unit programs supporting AI data centers are in final qualification, with combined 2.5D and HDFO capacity expected to nearly triple over the year. Korea serves as the primary production hub, with System-in-Package products migrating to Vietnam to free up floor space for the HDFO ramp. Government incentives under the CHIPS Act and a 25% investment tax credit are expected to contribute upward of $2.85 billion toward the Arizona project cost, though these inflows lag initial capital outflows.Growth remains back-half loaded, with one program expected to ramp to high volume and the second still uncertain on full-volume timing. Delays in qualification, equipment delivery or space buildout could compress results, making execution across milestones critical.

> Amkor Technology competes directly with ASE Technology, which holds greater scale, a wider customer base and deeper capacity across advanced packaging platforms. Taiwan Semiconductor continues expanding its proprietary packaging platforms, compressing the addressable market for independent assemblers like AMKR. Intel, once a reliable source of overflow packaging volumes for Amkor, is prioritizing its own in-house packaging capabilities, which could erode a historically stable revenue stream. With ASE Technology pulling ahead on scale, Taiwan Semiconductor vertically integrating, and Intel reducing its external packaging dependency, AMKR faces the challenge of defending its positioning on multiple fronts simultaneously, even as it pursues an ambitious and expensive capacity expansion of its own.

#### Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.97)*

> Intel(INTC) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

> Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -0.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -1.7% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has lost 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

> While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

> Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

> We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

#### Can AI Memory Demand Sustain Micron's Margin Expansion Ahead?
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.97)*

> Micron Technology, Inc.MU has been witnessing robust margin expansion over the past few quarters. In the last reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the company reported a non-GAAP gross margin of 56.8%, up from the year-ago quarter’s 39.5% and the previous quarter’s 45.7%.

> Micron Technology’s guidance for the second quarter depicts further scope of gross margin expansion. For the second quarter, it projects a non-GAAP gross margin of 68% (+/-100 basis points), reflecting a strong improvement from the year-ago quarter’s 37.9%. The company is benefiting from the rising artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure spending, which is driving demand for its memory chips and boosting margins.

> AI servers need far more memory than traditional systems. They require high-capacity DRAM and fast storage to process complex models efficiently. This raises average selling prices because customers prioritize performance over cost. When pricing improves, margins typically rise, especially for suppliers offering advanced products. Micron has been focusing on premium memory solutions such as high-bandwidth memory and advanced nodes, which carry better profitability than standard chips.

> Industry supply trends also support margins. Memory manufacturers have limited new capacity growth after past downturns, which has kept supply relatively tight. When demand rises faster than supply, pricing improves, and higher prices typically translate into stronger gross margins for Micron Technology.

> AI adoption across cloud, enterprise, and edge computing is still growing. As long as this trend continues and supply stays disciplined, AI-driven memory demand has the potential to sustain Micron Technology’s margin expansion in the near term.

#### Intel (INTC) Faces 'Show-Me' Reset as DA Davidson Initiates Neutral Rating
*Source: Insider Monkey | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.94)*

> Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of theAI Stocks to Watch. Wall Street believes Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is facing a “show-me” reset, with one research firm warning that current valuation is a reflection of overly optimistic assumptions. On February 12, DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria initiated coverage on Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) with a Neutral rating and a price target of $45.

> Intel’s transformation seems to be one of the most challenging turnarounds in the semiconductor industry. Not only is the company working toward restoring its leading-edge manufacturing leadership, but also building credibility as a third-party foundry.

> The research firm did acknowledge that there are “real developments across the business for investors to get excited about” at Intel. However, it remains a show-me story for now with execution remaining the key hurdle. Investors still need Intel to prove itself, particularly as the company hasn’t been profitable over the past twelve months.

> Analysts, however, are optimistic that this year Intel will manage to return to profitability. As such, the current stock price “continues to reflect assumptions we view are all too optimistic,” leading to its Neutral rating.

> Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) designs, manufactures, and sells advanced semiconductors, computer products, and technologies, delivering data storage, computer, networking, and communications platforms.

#### The Zacks Analyst Blog  NVIDIA, Super Micro Computer,  Advanced Micro Devices and Intel
*Source: Zacks | Date: Today | Sentiment: Positive (+0.99)*

> Chicago, IL – February 17, 2026 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include  NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Super Micro Computer, Inc. SMCI, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. AMD and Intel Corporation INTC.

> NVIDIA CorporationandSuper Micro Computer, Inc.are both currently riding the artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure boom. But with Supermicro facing margin pressure and NVIDIA offering far stronger profitability metrics, could NVDA now be the better investment? Let’s take a closer look –

> The rise in data center capital spending has led to stiff competition between NVIDIA and its competitors, includingAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. andIntel Corporation. However, despite the challenges, NVIDIA managed to post solid quarterly results consistently, banking on the rapid increase in AI. Quarter after quarter, NVIDIA’s performances were commendable due to the increasing demand for its chips, including the latest Blackwell architecture and cloud-based graphics processing units (GPUs).

> NVIDIA’s revenues jumped 62% year over year and 22% sequentially to $57 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2026, according to investor.nvidia.com. In fact, the company expects revenues for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2026 to come in at nearly $65 billion, with a plus or minus 2%. And why not? Thawing trade tensions between the United States and China are expected to support NVIDIA’s sales. The U.S. government has approved shipment of NVIDIA’s H200 AI chips to China, while Chinese authorities have permitted their sale to selected customers.

> AI is significantly increasing demand for hardware, which is likely benefiting Supermicro. The company’s Data Center Building Block Solutions (DCBBS) has seen growing adoption among AI clients, offering a comprehensive package that includes integrated servers, networking, storage, cooling, software and related services. This momentum has translated into robust revenue growth, with its fiscal second-quarter 2026 sales climbing 123% year over year to $12.7 billion, easily exceeding analysts’ expectations of $10.4 billion, according to ir.supermicro.com.
