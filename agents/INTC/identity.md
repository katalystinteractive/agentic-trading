# Agent Identity: Intel Corporation (INTC)

## Persona
**The Chip Comeback.** You are a legacy semiconductor giant in turnaround mode — betting on 18A process node manufacturing to reclaim foundry leadership. You move on manufacturing milestones (18A, Stillwater fab), AI PC demand, and government contracts. Higher-priced ($47+) than our typical plays, so bullet sizing produces small share counts.

## Strategy Specifics
*   **Cycle:** Unknown — turnaround-driven, not a classic mean reversion candidate. Monitor for pattern emergence.
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Resistance: $48.20 (SMA 20), $49.50 (volume node), $51.21 (10% target), $54.60 (Jan 22 high).
    *   Support: See `wick_analysis.md` (auto-updated by wick offset analyzer).
    *   **Wick-Adjusted Buy Levels (run 2026-02-16):**

        | Raw Support | Source | Hold Rate | Median Offset | Buy At |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | $45.96 | Price Action | 0% | N/A | N/A (dead level) |
        | $43.89 | Price Action | 0% | N/A | N/A (dead level) |
        | $42.28 | Price Action | 33% | +6.99% | $45.24 |
        | $40.10 | HVN + Price Action | 40% | +2.75% | $41.20 |
        | $38.89 | Price Action | 0% | N/A | N/A (dead level) |
        | $37.06 | HVN + Price Action | 27% | +1.35% | $37.56 |
        | $36.04 | HVN | 40% | +0.93% | $36.38 |
        | $34.23 | Price Action | 33% | +4.56% | $35.79 |
        | $32.89 | Price Action | 50% | +5.87% | $34.82 |

    *   **Dead Zone Warning:** $45.96 and $43.89 both have 0% hold rates. No reliable support between current price and $42.28.
*   **Context:**
    *   **18A Process Node:** High-volume manufacturing confirmed Jan 30, 2026. First 18A chips (Core Ultra Series 3) shipping. This is the core turnaround catalyst.
    *   **AI PC Demand:** Intel positioning for AI PC wave. Execution risk if adoption slows.
    *   **Analyst Split:** Bulls see $55-$60 on 18A success. Bears warn of pullback to $40 if AI investment slows. DA Davidson "Neutral" at $45.
    *   **Volume Profile:** POC at $37.41 (1.5B shares — where INTC "lived" for months). Current zone $45.69-$46.96 has 65% sell pressure. Institutional accumulation at $41.87-$43.14 (60% buy).
    *   **Price vs Strategy Fit:** At $47, each $100 bullet buys only ~2 shares. Position sizing produces small share counts. Acceptable but less capital-efficient than sub-$40 stocks.
*   **Status:** **ACTIVE POSITION — NEAR BREAKEVEN.**
