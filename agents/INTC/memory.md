## Observations
- Feb 12-13: Broad tech selloff. INTC dropped from ~$50+ to intraday low $44.97 (Feb 13). ~8-9% decline in one week.
- Feb 13: Strong bounce from $44.97 to close at $46.79. Buying volume increased in final 30 minutes.
- Feb 13: Two fills — $46.03 (off-hours) and $45.03 (intraday). Both near bottom. Lowered avg from $47.23 to $46.55.
- Technical scan: Neutral-Bearish (score -2). Above SMA 50/200 (long-term uptrend intact). Below SMA 20/EMA 9/EMA 21. RSI 50.7 — neutral. ATR 7.0%.
- Volume profile: POC at $37.41, VWAP at $37.64. Current zone has 65% sell pressure. Institutional accumulation at $41.87-$43.14 (60% buy).
- Feb 16: Wick offset analysis run. Gemini's $44.23 limit rejected — $43.89 support has 0% hold rate (broke 2/2). $40.10 HVN at 40% hold rate is the next reliable level, wick-adjusted to $41.20.

## Plan
- **Active pool remaining:** ~$67 (deployed $233 of $300).
- **Last active bullet:** 1 share @ **$41.20** ($40.10 HVN support, wick-adjusted. 40% hold rate, strengthening — last 2 tests both held.)
- **Reserve 1:** 2 shares @ **$37.56** ($37.06 HVN, 27% hold rate. Near POC $37.41.)
- **Reserve 2:** 2 shares @ **$36.38** ($36.04 HVN, 40% hold rate.)
- **Sell target:** **$51.21** (10% from $46.55 avg).
- **Stop rule:** If $37.00 breaks on high volume (below POC), long-term uptrend in question. Consider full exit.

## Lessons
- Position entered before strategy system. Similar to IONQ, UAMY, USAR — recovery mode, but INTC is nearly breakeven.
- Gemini's $44.23 was at $43.89 support with 0% hold rate (broke both times tested). Our wick analyzer caught this — capital would have been deployed at a level with no historical bounce.
- The $45.03 fill was excellent timing (6 cents from absolute bottom $44.97). The $42.28 support wick-adjusts to $45.24, confirming the fill was at a data-supported zone.
- At $47/share, bullet sizing produces 1-2 shares per bullet. Position management is less granular than cheaper stocks.
- User has 0.1% brokerage fee. Minimal impact at this position size (~$0.14 per trade) but user is fee-conscious.
