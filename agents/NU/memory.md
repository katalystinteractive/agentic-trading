# Memory: Nu Holdings (NU)

## Trade Log
- **2026-02-13:** Bullet 1 filled at $16.61 (6 shares). Mid-month low hit as expected.

## Observations
- Earnings Feb 25 — watch for pre-earnings run-up pattern.
- Mid-month bottoming rhythm held again (day 13).
- **2026-02-17 Earnings Gate decision:** Hold B1 (6 shares) through Feb 25 earnings. B2 at $14.88 is the trap — if NU sells off post-earnings (common pattern: Q1 2025 beat +7% → sold -19%, Q4 2024 beat +12% → sold -15%), B2 fills and avg drops to $15.75. If NU rips (Q3 2025 pattern: +9% day-1), ride toward $18.50 target. Only $100 at risk — starter position by design. Options flow call-heavy (P/C 0.14), Wall Street 79% Buy, OCC bank charter catalyst.
- **2026-02-18 News:** Price $17.17 (+3.4% from avg). Druckenmiller's 13F shows new Brazil/financials exposure (bullish signal). Simply Wall St highlights Chubb partnership as game-changer. Susquehanna PT raised to $22. Consensus for Feb 25: EPS $0.18 (+50% YoY), revenue $4.55B (+52%). Sentiment: 37% positive, overall Bullish. Mid-month bottoming pattern held — low was $16.84 today, B2 at $14.88 remains 13.3% away.
