#### Is Trending Stock Nu Holdings Ltd. (NU) a Buy Now?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-12 | Sentiment: Positive (+0.98)*

> Nu Holdings Ltd.(NU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.

> Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Banks - Foreign industry, which Nu  falls in, has gained 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

> Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

> Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

> We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

#### NU Stock Surges 46% in 6 Months: Does the Buying Level Exist?
*Source: Zacks | Date: 2026-02-09 | Sentiment: Positive (+1.00)*

> Nu Holdings Ltd.NU has witnessed a 46% rise in its stock price over the six months, outpacing the broader industry’s 27% growth.

> This piece examines NU’s recent performance and growth trajectory to determine whether the stock is still attractive after the sharp rise.

> Nu Holdings continues to demonstrate why it remains one of the most compelling digital banking platforms globally. The company’s performance in Brazil stands out as a major strength, with a customer base of 110 million and coverage of over 60% of the adult population. Maintaining an activity rate above 85% at this scale is no small achievement; it highlights deep customer engagement rather than superficial user growth. This combination of scale and engagement creates a powerful moat, allowing NU to expand product adoption continuously. The ability to grow while improving efficiency, as reflected in its declining efficiency ratio, reinforces the strength of its core business model.

> Beyond Brazil, NU’s accelerating traction in Mexico and Colombia adds an important second growth engine. Mexico has already crossed 13 million customers, while Colombia is approaching 4 million, showing that Nu’s digital-first banking model travels well across geographies. These markets are still in relatively early stages, offering a long runway for customer acquisition and product cross-selling. The consistency in engagement metrics across regions suggests that Nu Holdings is not simply exporting a product but is successfully replicating a scalable platform. This geographic diversification reduces overreliance on a single market and strengthens the company’s long-term growth profile.

> Financially, NU’s record revenues and expanding credit portfolio underline the quality of its growth. Rising ARPAC indicates that customers are not only joining the platform but also using it more actively across products. The credit portfolio’s expansion across cards, secured and unsecured lending, shows increasing maturity and diversification, which supports sustainable earnings growth. Importantly, this expansion has been accompanied by healthy asset quality metrics and disciplined risk management. Strong profitability, reflected in rising net income and a record return on equity, demonstrates NU’s ability to balance growth with financial discipline. Looking ahead, management’s vision of becoming an AI-first bank further strengthens the investment case, positioning Nu Holdings to enhance efficiency, personalize customer experiences, and reinforce its competitive edge in digital banking.
