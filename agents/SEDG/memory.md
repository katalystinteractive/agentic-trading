# Agent Memory: SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG)

## Trade Log
*No position. Watchlist only.*

## Observations
- **2026-02-16:** Added to watchlist alongside CLF after screening 8 candidates. SEDG has the right price ($36, same as AR) and Early-month cycle timing, but the $32-$35 dead zone (8-23% hold rates, heavily tested) blocks immediate entry.
- First actionable support: $30.74 (36% hold, wick-adjusted $31.14) requires a 12% drop from $35.53.
- Best support: $28.21 (50% hold, wick-adjusted $29.43) requires a 17% drop.
- SEDG recovered from $11 to $48 in 8 months (Jun-Nov 2025), then pulled back to $28-$36 range. May be forming a new channel, but needs more time to build support data.
- Solar sector provides good diversification from the portfolio.

## Lessons
- *A stock trading at its POC isn't automatically a good entry. SEDG sits at $35.96 POC but the wick data shows the $32-$35 zone breaks constantly. Volume equilibrium doesn't mean support.*
