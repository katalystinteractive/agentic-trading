# Agent Memory: SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG)

## Trade Log
*No position. Watchlist only.*

## Observations
- **2026-02-16:** Added to watchlist alongside CLF after screening 8 candidates. SEDG has the right price ($36, same as AR) and Early-month cycle timing, but the $32-$35 dead zone (8-23% hold rates, heavily tested) blocks immediate entry.
- First actionable support: $30.74 (36% hold, wick-adjusted $31.14) requires a 12% drop from $35.53.
- Best support: $28.21 (50% hold, wick-adjusted $29.43) requires a 17% drop.
- SEDG recovered from $11 to $48 in 8 months (Jun-Nov 2025), then pulled back to $28-$36 range. May be forming a new channel, but needs more time to build support data.
- Solar sector provides good diversification from the portfolio.

## Observations (continued)
- **2026-02-18 News: Q4 EARNINGS BEAT.** Adj loss -$0.14 vs est -$0.63 (beat by 74%). Revenue $335.4M (+71% YoY, beat by 3.2%). Shipped 98.8K inverters, 2.87M optimizers, 280 MWh batteries. Adj gross profit $74.5M (vs -$112.3M loss year-ago). Cash $455M (vs $275M YoY). Q1 2026 guide: $305M (3% above consensus). Full-year 2025: $1.18B revenue, loss narrowed from -$22.99/share to -$2.38. Stock gapped to $40.31 intraday then sold off hard to close $35.10 (-5.5%). Still in the $32-$35 dead zone. Sentiment: Bullish (43% positive). The selloff from $40 confirms the resistance zone identified in the wick analysis. Entry thesis unchanged: wait for pullback to $29-$31 support.

## Lessons
- *A stock trading at its POC isn't automatically a good entry. SEDG sits at $35.96 POC but the wick data shows the $32-$35 zone breaks constantly. Volume equilibrium doesn't mean support.*
