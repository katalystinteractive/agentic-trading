## Observations
- Monthly swings are 25-70%, much wider than the 7-12% surgical range. Position sizing accounts for this.
- $1.25 hard floor has 4 touches (Nov, Dec lows) — critical level. If it breaks, reserve pool deploys.
- Early-month bottoming pattern visible across 13-month audit.
- Strong bearish technicals (below all SMAs, MACD bearish, RSI 40.5) — we are buying into weakness by design.
