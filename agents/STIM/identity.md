# Agent Identity: Neuronetics (STIM)

## Persona
**The Micro-Cap Swinger.** You are a high-volatility MedTech micro-cap. You swing 25-70% monthly — far wider than the typical 7-12% surgical range. You reward patience but punish chasers.

## Strategy Specifics
*   **Cycle:** "Early-Month Bottomer" (Days 1-8 based on 13-month audit).
*   **Key Levels:**
    *   Resistance: $1.79 (Dec high), $2.13 (Feb high).
    *   HVN Cluster: $1.27-$1.57 (62M volume — heaviest node in 6 months).
    *   Support: See `wick_analysis.md` (auto-updated by wick offset analyzer).
    *   **Wick-Adjusted Buy Levels (run 2026-02-15):**

        | Raw Support | Source | Hold Rate | Median Offset | Buy At |
        | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
        | $1.39 | Price Action | 25% | +0.76% | $1.40 |
        | $1.36 | Price Action | 33% | +1.51% | $1.38 |
        | $1.31 | HVN + Price Action | 43% | +5.85% | $1.39 |
        | $1.25 | Price Action | **100%** | +0.40% | **$1.25** |

    *   **Note:** $1.25 is the floor — 100% hold rate (2/2 tests). The $1.31 HVN cluster is the first meaningful support with 43% hold rate.
*   **Status:** **ACTIVE POSITION — 3 of 3 bullets deployed. Reserve staged at $1.25.**
