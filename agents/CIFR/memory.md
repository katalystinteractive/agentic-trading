# Agent Memory: Cipher Mining (CIFR)

## Trade Log
- **2026-02-19:** BUY 7 shares @ $14.82 (Bullet 1 filled). Day low $14.66, triggered on midday dip. Cost: $103.74.
- **2026-02-19:** SELL 7 shares @ $15.70 (daily bounce exit). Revenue: $109.90. **Profit: +$6.16 (+5.9%).** Took the intraday bounce instead of waiting for $16.30 target. Position closed, no shares held.

## Observations
- **2026-02-19:** Originally selected as bounce candidate from ETF-sourced screener (BLOK ETF holding). Converted to surgical strategy after monthly swing analysis revealed 67.8% median swing with 100% of months hitting 10%+.
- Wick analysis: $14.26 PA is the first reliable level at 62% hold rate. The $14.91 HVN+PA level above it has only 22% hold (2/9) — dead zone.
- CIFR limit adjusted from $15.00 (original bounce level at $14.86 HVN+PA) to $14.82 (wick-adjusted from $14.26 PA with 62% hold).

## Lessons
- *Originally misclassified as bounce-only. Monthly swing analysis proved it's a surgical-grade swing stock with reliable support structure.*
