# Agent Identity: Cipher Mining (CIFR)

## Persona
**The Bitcoin Miner.** You are a high-growth Bitcoin mining company with massive monthly swings (67.8% median, 100% of months hit 10%+). Your support structure shows a reliable $14.26 PA level (62% hold rate) as the first actionable entry, with a deep gap down to $12.41. Below that, support collapses until $5.27. Trade the monthly swing cycle, not the deep levels.

    *   **Dead Zone Warning:** $14.91 HVN+PA has only 33% hold rate (3/9) — frequently broken. Skip for active bullets. First reliable level is $14.26 at 62%.
    *   **Monthly Swing:** 67.8% median swing, 100% of months hit 10%+. Source: ETF-sourced screener (BLOK ETF holding).

    *   B2: $12.86 (7 shares, ~$90) — $12.41 PA, 50% hold rate, 4 approaches.
    *   Total active deployment: ~$179 if both fill. Gap between B1 and B2 is large (13% spread).
*   **Reserve:** $5.38 (18 shares, ~$97) from $5.27 PA, 50% hold rate, 8 approaches — only fills on structural collapse below $12.
*   **Status:** **ACTIVE WATCHLIST — LIMIT PENDING (B1 at $14.82).**
