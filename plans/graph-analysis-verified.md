# Reactive Dependency Graph — Architecture Analysis

**Date**: 2026-03-28 (Saturday)
**Status**: VERIFIED — converged in 2 iterations (4 fixes applied)
**Purpose**: Define the complete node/edge/signal architecture for the trading system's dependency graph. Every claim in this document is traced to actual code and verified against the codebase.

**Verification History**:
- Iteration 1: 7 findings → 4 FIX NOW (node count 12→14, total recalc, vix_5d_pct location, catastrophic line numbers), 3 ACKNOWLEDGE
- Iteration 2: 0 findings → converged

## 1. What Problem This Solves

The daily analyzer produces a 1,700-line report. Actions are buried. Reasons for actions are hand-coded strings in `_compute_buy_reason()` and `_compute_sell_reason()` — one level deep, not composable. When a new fill changes the average cost which changes the sell target which makes the broker sell order wrong, the user sees "Avg cost now $8.82 → 6% = $9.35 (was $9.95)" but NOT the full chain: "Fill at $7.79 on 3/23 → avg pulled from $9.82 to $8.82 → sell target moved $10.41 → $9.35 → broker has $9.95, needs ADJUST."

The graph solves this by:
1. **Declaring dependencies as edges** — not implicit in function call order
2. **Propagating signals with accumulated reasons** — each node adds its piece
3. **Persisting state** — diff against previous run to surface CHANGES
4. **Activating only "hot" report nodes** — unchanged items are silent

## 2. The System's Data Sources (Leaf Nodes)

Every leaf traces to a specific file or API call. No LLM generates any leaf value.

### 2.1 File-Based State (changes on user action)

| Leaf Node | File | Read By | Writer | Fields Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `portfolio` | `portfolio.json` | `portfolio_manager._load()` | `cmd_fill()`, `cmd_sell()`, manual | positions, pending_orders, watchlist, capital |
| `ticker_profiles` | `ticker_profiles.json` | `broker_reconciliation._load_profiles()` | `sell_target_calculator.py` | optimal_target_pct per ticker |
| `multi_period_results` | `data/backtest/multi-period/multi-period-results.json` | `shared_utils._load_mp_data()` (mtime-cached) | `multi_period_scorer.py` | allocations[ticker] → active_pool, reserve_pool |
| `trade_history` | `trade_history.json` | `broker_reconciliation._load_trade_history_buys()` | `portfolio_manager._record_trade()` | trades[] with date, price, shares, zone |
| `cooldowns` | `cooldown.json` | `daily_analyzer.find_deployment_tickers()` | `cooldown_manager` | reeval_date per ticker |

### 2.2 Per-Ticker Files (changes on tool run)

| Leaf Node | File Pattern | Read By | Writer | Staleness Check |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `{tk}:cycle_timing` | `tickers/{TK}/cycle_timing.json` | `shared_utils.load_cycle_timing()` | `cycle_timing_analyzer.py` | >14 days → stale flag |
| `{tk}:wick_data` | (recomputed fresh, not read from cache) | `wick_offset_analyzer.analyze_stock_data()` | yfinance 13mo OHLCV | Always fresh (fetched per call) |

### 2.3 Live Market Data (changes every run)

| Leaf Node | API | Function | Period | Fallback |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `live_prices` | yfinance | `daily_analyzer._fetch_position_prices()` | 5d | `{}` empty dict |
| `live_vix` | yfinance ^VIX | `shared_regime._fetch_regime_data()` | 5d | None → regime defaults "Neutral" |
| `live_indices` | yfinance SPY/QQQ/IWM | `shared_regime._fetch_regime_data()` | 6mo (for 50-SMA) | Skip failed indices |
| `{tk}:live_earnings` | yfinance ticker.earnings_dates | `earnings_gate.check_earnings_gate()` | fresh per call | (None,None) → CLEAR |
| `{tk}:price_3mo` | yfinance | `daily_analyzer._fetch_technical_data()` | 3mo daily | {} → SKIPPED momentum |

---

## 3. Computed Nodes (Deterministic Transforms)

Each computed node has exactly one function, documented inputs, and a deterministic output.

### 3.1 Market-Level (one per run)

| Node | Function | File:Line | Inputs | Output | Used By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `regime` | `shared_regime.fetch_regime_detail()` → `classify_regime()` | `shared_regime.py:59` | live_indices (50-SMA), live_vix | "Risk-On" / "Neutral" / "Risk-Off" | verdicts, entry_gates, deployment, dip_watchlist |
| `vix` | extracted from regime call | `shared_regime.py:59` | live_vix | float (e.g., 31.0) | entry_gates |
| `vix_5d_pct` | computed in `print_market_regime()` | `daily_analyzer.py:84` | live_vix 5d history | float (e.g., +18.7%) | entry_gates (CAUTION rule) |

### 3.2 Per-Ticker Computed Nodes

For each active ticker TK (27 tickers currently), these nodes are instantiated:

| Node | Function | File:Line | Inputs | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `{tk}:avg_cost` | direct read | `portfolio.json` | portfolio.positions[tk].avg_cost | float |
| `{tk}:shares` | direct read | `portfolio.json` | portfolio.positions[tk].shares | int |
| `{tk}:entry_date` | direct read | `portfolio.json` | portfolio.positions[tk].entry_date | str (YYYY-MM-DD or "pre-...") |
| `{tk}:price` | lookup | live_prices[tk] | live_prices | float |
| `{tk}:pl_pct` | arithmetic | inline | (price - avg_cost) / avg_cost × 100 | float |
| `{tk}:drawdown` | arithmetic | inline | same as pl_pct (negative = loss) | float |
| `{tk}:days_held` | `compute_days_held()` | `shared_utils.py:283` | entry_date, today | (int, str, bool) |
| `{tk}:time_status` | `compute_time_stop()` | `shared_utils.py:302` | days_held, is_pre, regime | WITHIN / APPROACHING / EXCEEDED |
| `{tk}:earnings_gate` | `check_earnings_gate()` | `earnings_gate.py:81` | ticker, yfinance | CLEAR / APPROACHING / BLOCKED / FALLING_KNIFE |
| `{tk}:rsi` | `calc_rsi()` | `technical_scanner.py:13` | price_3mo close series | float (0-100) |
| `{tk}:macd` | `calc_macd()` | `technical_scanner.py:23` | price_3mo close series | {macd, signal, histogram} |
| `{tk}:momentum` | `classify_momentum()` | `shared_utils.py:321` | rsi, macd_vs_signal, histogram | Bullish / Bearish / Neutral / SKIPPED |
| `{tk}:pool` | `get_ticker_pool()` | `shared_utils.py:55` | multi_period_results, portfolio capital | {active_pool, reserve_pool, source} |
| `{tk}:sell_target` | `compute_recommended_sell()` | `broker_reconciliation.py:137` | avg_cost, ticker_profiles, portfolio target_exit | (price, basis_str) — priority: optimized > target_exit > 6% |

---

## 4. Decision Nodes (Rule Engines)

These nodes apply deterministic rules and produce the verdicts/gates that drive actions.

### 4.1 Per-Position Decision Nodes (16 tickers with shares > 0)

| Node | Function | File:Line | Inputs | Output | Rules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `{tk}:verdict` | `compute_verdict()` | `shared_utils.py:386` | avg_cost, price, entry_date, note, earnings_gate, momentum, regime | (verdict, rule, detail) | R1-R16, first-match-wins |
| `{tk}:catastrophic` | threshold check | `daily_analyzer.py:334-336` | drawdown | severity: WARNING(-15%), HARD_STOP(-25%), EXIT_REVIEW(-40%) | 3 thresholds |

### 4.2 Per-Order Decision Nodes (54 pending orders)

| Node | Function | File:Line | Inputs | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `{tk}:{label}:entry_gate` | `compute_entry_gate()` | `shared_utils.py:475` | regime, vix, vix_5d_pct, earnings_gate, order_price, live_price, is_watchlist | (market_gate, earnings_gate, combined) |

### 4.3 Per-Ticker Reconciliation (27 tickers)

| Node | Function | File:Line | Inputs | Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `{tk}:recon` | `reconcile_ticker()` | `broker_reconciliation.py:266` | position, orders, wick_levels, trade_buys, profiles, pool | recon dict with actions[] |

Each recon action is itself a decision: OK / ADJUST price / ADJUST shares / CANCEL (orphaned) / PLACE.

---

## 5. Report Nodes (What Surfaces to the User)

Report nodes are the "leaves" of the OUTPUT tree. They activate only when something changed.

| Report Node | Depends On | Activates When | Dashboard Category |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `{tk}:sell_order_action` | sell_target, shares, recon | broker sell order ≠ computed target | PLACE / ADJUST |
| `{tk}:buy_order_action` | wick_data, pool, recon | broker buy order ≠ wick-recommended | ADJUST / CANCEL |
| `{tk}:verdict_alert` | verdict | verdict changed since last run | CHANGED |
| `{tk}:gate_alert` | entry_gate | gate status changed since last run | CHANGED |
| `{tk}:catastrophic_alert` | catastrophic | threshold crossed | URGENT |
| `regime_change` | regime | regime label changed since last run | CHANGED |
| `{tk}:review` | verdict | verdict == "REVIEW" | REVIEW |

## 8. Node Count Summary

| Category | Count | Pattern |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Market-level leaf nodes | 5 | portfolio, live_prices, live_vix, live_indices, multi_period_results |
| Per-ticker leaf nodes | 27 × 3 = 81 | earnings, price_3mo, wick_data |
| Static file leaves | 3 | ticker_profiles, trade_history, cooldowns |
| Market-level computed | 3 | regime, vix, vix_5d_pct |
| Per-ticker computed | 27 × 14 = 378 | avg_cost, shares, entry_date, price, pl_pct, drawdown, days_held, time_status, earnings_gate, rsi, macd, momentum, pool, sell_target |
| Per-ticker decisions | 16 × 2 = 32 | verdict, catastrophic (positions only) |
| Per-order decisions | 54 × 1 = 54 | entry_gate |
| Per-ticker recon | 27 × 1 = 27 | recon |
| Report nodes | 27 × 4 + 1 = 109 | sell_order_action, buy_order_action, verdict_alert, catastrophic_alert, regime_change |
| **TOTAL** | **~692** | Dynamic, scales with ticker count |

---

## 9. Persistence Schema (graph_state.json)

**What gets saved** — decision outcomes, not raw data:

```json
{
  "run_date": "2026-03-28",
  "run_ts": "2026-03-28T17:45:30",
  "regime": "Risk-Off",
  "vix": 31.0,
  "vix_5d_pct": 18.7,
  "tickers": {
    "CLSK": {
      "avg_cost": 8.99,
      "shares": 42,
      "price": 8.66,
      "pl_pct": -3.7,
      "verdict": "MONITOR",
      "verdict_rule": "R16",
      "catastrophic": null,
      "momentum": "Bearish",
      "earnings_gate": "CLEAR",
      "time_status": "WITHIN",
      "pool": {"active": 321, "reserve": 322, "source": "multi-period-scorer"},
      "sell_target": {"price": 10.07, "basis": "optimized 12.0%"},
      "orders": {
        "A1:8.40": {"gate": "REVIEW", "action": "OK"},
        "SELL:10.07": {"action": "PLACE"}
      }
    }
  },
  "recon_actions": [
    {"side": "SELL", "ticker": "CLSK", "action": "PLACE", "rec_price": 10.07, "rec_shares": 42,
     "reason": "...", "signal_chain": "..."}
  ]
}
```

**What gets diffed** — only decision-level changes:
- Regime label change
- Per-ticker: verdict flip, catastrophic severity change, gate change
- Per-order: action flag change (OK → ADJUST, etc.)

**What does NOT get diffed** — noise:
- Raw price movements (only the RESULTING verdict/gate matters)
- Raw VIX value (only the RESULTING regime matters)
- Raw RSI/MACD (only the RESULTING momentum matters)

## 10. Design Decisions

### 10.1 Dynamic Node Creation (not static declaration)

Tickers come and go (new fills, closed positions). The graph must:
1. Load portfolio.json to discover active tickers
2. Create per-ticker nodes dynamically
3. Handle "ticker was in prev_state but not in current" (position closed → "Resolved" signal)
4. Handle "ticker is in current but not in prev_state" (new position → context signal, not action)

### 10.2 Wick Data is Recomputed, Not Cached

`analyze_stock_data()` fetches 13 months of OHLCV fresh every call. The wick_analysis.md file is human-readable output, NOT a cache input. The graph's `{tk}:wick_data` leaf always contains fresh data.

### 10.3 Sell Prices Are Pool-Independent

Pool size affects BUY share counts. It NEVER affects sell prices. The sell target chain is: avg_cost → sell_target (optimized/target_exit/6%) → sell_price. No pool edge exists in the sell path.

### 10.4 Subprocess Sections Stay Outside the Graph

Parts 3-6 (perf analysis, deployment, fitness, screening) are slow subprocesses (3-14 minutes). They don't feed the Action Dashboard. They stay as subprocesses, running AFTER the graph resolves and the dashboard prints.

### 10.5 First Run Behavior

On first run, `prev_state = {}`. Every node has `prev_value = None`. The CHANGED section shows "No previous state — first run." No false alerts.

### 10.6 Graph is a Wiring Layer, Not a Rewrite

The graph WRAPS existing Python functions — it does NOT replace them. `compute_verdict()`, `classify_momentum()`, `compute_entry_gate()`, `reconcile_ticker()`, `compute_recommended_sell()` stay exactly as they are. Graph nodes call these functions. No computation logic is duplicated or reimplemented inside the graph. If a function changes, the graph automatically uses the updated version.

### 10.7 Single-Edge Extensibility

Adding a new data source or dependency must require declaring ONE node and ONE edge — not modifying multiple files. If adding a new node requires touching main(), _build_graph_state(), _compute_state_diff(), and print_action_dashboard(), the graph has failed its purpose. The graph engine handles propagation, persistence, and dashboard rendering from the declared structure alone.

---

## 11. What the Graph Engine Must Support

Based on this analysis, the graph engine needs:

1. **Dynamic node creation** — add nodes at runtime based on portfolio contents
2. **Namespaced per-ticker nodes** — `{tk}:verdict`, `{tk}:A1:entry_gate`
3. **Batch leaf loading** — load portfolio once, distribute to per-ticker nodes
4. **Signal propagation with reason composition** — leaf→intermediate→report chains
5. **State persistence** — save decision outcomes to JSON
6. **State diffing** — compare previous run, surface changes as signals
7. **Report node activation** — only "hot" nodes surface in dashboard
8. **Lifecycle handling** — new tickers, closed positions, removed orders
9. **~692 nodes, ~27 tickers** — must resolve in <5 seconds (all fast except yfinance)
10. **Wrap, don't rewrite** — graph nodes call existing functions, no logic duplication
11. **Single-edge extensibility** — new dependency = one node + one edge declaration

---

## 12. Verification Checklist

After implementation, verify:

- [ ] Every report node's reason chain traces back to a specific leaf change
- [ ] "No change" between runs produces zero activated reports
- [ ] New fill → sell_order_action ACTIVATED with full chain (fill → avg → target → action)
- [ ] Regime flip → all entry gates re-evaluated, changed ones ACTIVATED
- [ ] Pool resize → buy order shares change, ACTIVATED with pool reason
- [ ] Wick refresh → orphaned orders ACTIVATED with level-shift reason
- [ ] Position closed → "Resolved" signal in CHANGED section
- [ ] graph_state.json written with all decision outcomes
- [ ] Next run loads prev state and correctly diffs
- [ ] Dashboard shows ONLY activated reports, grouped by priority
